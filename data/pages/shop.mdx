These are the 4 supplements I currently use to great effect. You don't need to buy all of them, but many people around the world no matter their diet are likely to be deficient in one or more of these minerals and vitamins.

If you had to pick just one, my recommendation would be the Boron. It is so useful in so many ways, and I'm seeing fantastic results from using it myself, and with my patients.

    *Boron: The Multi-Talented Mineral That Promotes Brain Function, Supports Bone Health, and Enhances Athletic Performance.*

Boron is a trace mineral that is essential for various bodily functions, including brain function, bone health, and athletic performance. It has been shown to have numerous health benefits, making it an excellent supplement to consider.

Boron plays a vital role in cognitive function by increasing brain activity, improving memory and focus, and supporting healthy brain aging. Additionally, it supports bone health by promoting the absorption of calcium and magnesium, which are essential for maintaining strong bones and preventing osteoporosis.

Moreover, boron has been found to enhance athletic performance by increasing testosterone levels and reducing inflammation. These benefits can help athletes recover faster from exercise, reduce the risk of injury, and support muscle growth.

Overall, boron is a multi-talented mineral that supports various functions in the body, making it a valuable supplement to consider. Whether you're looking to support your brain and bone health or improve your athletic performance, adding boron to your supplement regimen can help you achieve your health and fitness goals.

    *Vitamin K2 + D3: The Dynamic Duo for Strong Bones, Heart Health, and Immune Function.*

Vitamin K2 and D3 are two essential nutrients that work together to support a range of functions in the body. Vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, helping to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. It also plays a critical role in immune function and can help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases.

Vitamin K2, on the other hand, works alongside vitamin D3 to ensure that calcium is deposited in the right places, such as bones and teeth, rather than in arteries or other soft tissues. This helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other health problems.

Together, vitamin K2 and D3 form a powerful combination that supports bone health, heart health, and immune function. By taking a supplement that contains both nutrients, you can ensure that your body has everything it needs to function optimally. Whether you're looking to improve your overall health or simply want to support specific areas of your body, vitamin K2 and D3 are a smart choice.

    *Vitamin B3: The Energizing Nutrient That Supports Brain Function, Skin Health, and Cardiovascular Wellness.*

Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in a range of bodily functions. One of its most well-known benefits is its ability to support energy production by converting food into glucose, which is then used by the body for fuel. This can help combat fatigue and boost endurance, making it a popular supplement among athletes.

Vitamin B3 also supports brain function by promoting the production of neurotransmitters, which are essential for cognitive processes such as memory and learning. Additionally, it supports skin health by helping to maintain the skin's barrier function, which helps to prevent dryness and irritation.

Furthermore, vitamin B3 has been shown to have a positive impact on cardiovascular wellness by improving cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation. It can also help dilate blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure and improve circulation.

Overall, vitamin B3 is a versatile nutrient that supports numerous bodily functions, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to optimize their health and wellness. Whether you're looking to boost energy levels, support brain function, improve skin health, or promote cardiovascular wellness, vitamin B3 is a nutrient worth considering.

Melatonin is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body's pineal gland, and it plays a crucial role in regulating sleep and wake cycles. As a supplement, melatonin is often used to help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.

In addition to its sleep-promoting benefits, melatonin also has other health benefits. It has been shown to support immune health by helping to regulate the body's immune system and protect against harmful pathogens.

Furthermore, melatonin can help combat jet lag, a common problem for travelers who cross time zones. Taking melatonin before bedtime in the new time zone can help reset the body's internal clock, making it easier to adjust to the new schedule.

Melatonin is a safe and natural sleep aid that can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their sleep quality, support their immune system, or combat jet lag. Whether you're dealing with occasional sleep issues or are looking for a long-term solution for better sleep, melatonin is a supplement worth considering.

There's a lot of information online about diet, far more than you could ever consume in a lifetime, but how do you know what's legitimate advice and what's just nonsense?

It is hard, but one way is to consider purchasing a book. Sadly anybody can make a YouTube and either rehash other people's content, or just make up garbage and give bad health advice. Now they could also write a book, but it's far less likely to happen.

Books can be a great source of information, but simply put they are also just nice to hold and read.

These are the books I would recommend.

    *The Carnivore Diet*

    Shawn Baker’s Carnivore Diet is a revolutionary, paradigm-breaking nutritional strategy that takes contemporary dietary theory and dumps it on its head. It breaks just about all the “rules” and delivers outstanding results. At its heart is a focus on simplicity rather than complexity, subtraction rather than addition, making this an incredibly effective diet that is also easy to follow.

    Carnivore Diet reviews some of the supporting evolutionary, historical, and nutritional science that gives us clues as to why so many people are having great success with this meat-focused way of eating. It highlights dramatic real-world transformations experienced by people of all types. Common disease conditions that are often thought to be lifelong and progressive are often reversed on this diet, and in this book, Baker discusses some of the theory behind that phenomenon as well. It outlines a comprehensive strategy for incorporating the Carnivore Diet as a tool or a lifelong eating style, and Baker offers a thorough discussion of the most common misconceptions about this diet and the problems people have when transitioning to it.

    *Carnivore Cure is the first elimination protocol to explain how to adopt a meat-based diet to bring about healing. Get back to optimal health by finding the perfect foods to fuel your individual body.*

Most elimination diets work to an extent but fail to consider all the individual, physical symptoms, and food sensitivities. Most elimination diets remove processed foods and additives but fail to remove plant-based toxins that can contribute to disease.

Until now.

Introducing, Carnivore Cure.

You start with meats that have the least number of allergens and sensitivities. Once you reach a baseline of health, then you can incorporate other meats that may have previously caused a sensitivity. As you heal the gut, if you choose to, you can slowly add back plant-based foods.

Carnivore Cure will allow you to figure out what plant-based foods can work for your body in the long term. The Carnivore Cure will support you to find your happy medium by focusing on meat-based diet while incorporating the safest plants with most food intolerances considered.

This book provides you a step by step protocol to optimal health while also providing you extensive nutritional information and support for a meat-based diet, including debunking nutrition misinformation and providing lifestyle support through the lens of holistic health.

YOU CAN HEAL. Because the right food is medicine.

Eliminate the wrong foods and eat the right foods for you, and you alone. Take your life back with the Carnivore Cure.

    *Lies My Doctor Told Me*
    
    Has your doctor lied to you? Eat low-fat and high-carb, including plenty of "healthy" whole grains-does that sound familiar? Perhaps this is what you were told at your last doctor's appointment or visit with a nutritionist, or perhaps it is something you read online when searching for a healthy diet. And perhaps you've been misled.

Dr. Ken Berry is here to dispel the myths and misinformation that have been perpetuated by the medical and food industries for decades. This updated and expanded edition of Dr. Berry's bestseller Lies My Doctor Told Me exposes the truth behind all kinds of "lies" told by well-meaning but misinformed medical practitioners. Nutritional therapy is often overlooked in medical school, and the information provided to physicians is often outdated. However, the negative consequences on your health remain the same. Advice to avoid healthy fats and stay out of the sun has been proven to be detrimental to longevity and wreak havoc on your system.

In this book, Dr. Berry will enlighten you about nutrition and life choices, their role in our health, and how to begin an educated conversation with your doctor about finding the right path for you. This book will teach you-

. How doctors are taught to think about nutrition and other preventative health measures-and how they should be thinking
. How the Food Pyramid and MyPlate came into existence and why they should change
. The facts about fat intake and heart health the truth about the effects of whole wheat on the human body
. The role of dairy in your diet the truth about salt-friend or foe?
. The dangers and benefits of hormone therapy
. New information about inflammation and how it should be viewed by doctors

Come out of the darkness and let Ken Berry be your guide to optimal health and harmony!

    *Toxic Superfoods*
    
    An eye-opening guide that exposes the toxins lurking within commonly touted "superfoods" like spinach, almonds, and sweet potatoes, and offers ways to reshape your diet to begin healing.

Your spinach smoothie might be making you sick. But there's good news- You can safely reverse your load of oxalates-the chemical toxins produced by many plants-and discover vibrant health.

Oxalates most famously cause kidney stones, but they also promote gut problems, chronic pain, joint pain, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, mineral deficiency, sleep disorders, osteoporosis, fatigue, and brain fog. Modern diets, especially ones that are gluten-free, keto, or plant-heavy, tend to be overloaded with oxalates; in fact, health favourites like certain leafy greens, sweet potatoes, turmeric, chia seeds, raspberries, and almonds are especially high in oxalates.

After suffering for decades from chronic joint inflammation, back pain, and other problems, health and nutrition educator, Sally Norton, MPH, discovered that the culprits were the oxalates hiding within her healthy, organic vegetarian diet. Now working with clients to safely reverse their oxalate load, she believes that most of us would enjoy better lifelong health with fewer oxalates in our food.

Shining light on what might be nothing short of a hidden epidemic, Toxic Superfoods offers solutions where none have existed before, showing how to identify whether you have a problem and offering a timely research-backed plan with recipes and handy food charts, plus a guide to key supplementation for safely reversing your oxalate load.

In this ground-breaking guide, Norton reveals that the popular dictum to "eat more plants" can be misleading. Toxic Superfoods gives health-seekers a chance for improved energy, optimum brain performance, graceful aging, and true relief from chronic pain.

    *Vitamin K2 + D3: The Dynamic Duo for Strong Bones, Heart Health, and Immune Function.*

Vitamin K2 and D3 are two essential nutrients that work together to support a range of functions in the body. Vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, helping to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. It also plays a critical role in immune function and can help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases.

Vitamin K2, on the other hand, works alongside vitamin D3 to ensure that calcium is deposited in the right places, such as bones and teeth, rather than in arteries or other soft tissues. This helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other health problems.

Together, vitamin K2 and D3 form a powerful combination that supports bone health, heart health, and immune function. By taking a supplement that contains both nutrients, you can ensure that your body has everything it needs to function optimally. Whether you're looking to improve your overall health or simply want to support specific areas of your body, vitamin K2 and D3 are a smart choice.

    *Vitamin B3: The Energizing Nutrient That Supports Brain Function, Skin Health, and Cardiovascular Wellness.*

Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in a range of bodily functions. One of its most well-known benefits is its ability to support energy production by converting food into glucose, which is then used by the body for fuel.

Additionally, it supports skin health by helping to maintain the skin's barrier function, which helps to prevent dryness and irritation.

Furthermore, vitamin B3 has been shown to have a positive impact on cardiovascular wellness by improving cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation. It can also help dilate blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure and improve circulation.

Overall, vitamin B3 is a versatile nutrient that supports numerous bodily functions, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to optimize their health and wellness. Whether you're looking to boost energy levels, support brain function, improve skin health, or promote cardiovascular wellness, vitamin B3 is a nutrient worth considering.

Melatonin is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body's pineal gland, and it plays a crucial role in regulating sleep and wake cycles. As a supplement, melatonin is often used to help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.

In addition to its sleep-promoting benefits, melatonin also has other health benefits. It has been shown to support immune health by helping to regulate the body's immune system and protect against harmful pathogens.
