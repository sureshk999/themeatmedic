Test

Are you looking for a Doctor to help you on your particular health journey?

Tired of Doctors giving you the slip or the run around, fobbing off your symptoms or telling you that there's nothing to worry about but you know you are unwell?

Do you need a functional or integrative Doctor to take your symptoms seriously?

Then Dr Suresh Khirwadkar (The Meat Medic) is available to help you.

Due to Medicolegal implications I am only able to consult as a doctor for Australian patients

For people outside of Australia I can offer coaching only and I would suggest you look at my [membership](/community) options instead.

# Podcast

I run The Meat Medic Podcast, a health and wellness podcast based primarily around animal based nutrition, low carbohydrate diets and nutrition. I promote positive changes to mental and physical health through lifestyle changes.

If you want to listen to the podcast it is available on all major podcast channels and available via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbsrn0KztGSUwUEYQz7cDSQ).

If you wish to be a guest on the podcast, please [email me](mailto:admin@drsuresh.com.au) with a request to join the podcast. Please include as much information as possible including your bio, social media links and why you want to guest on the podcast. I will then contact you for further information.

Do not worry if you aren't a celebrity, influencer or a health care professional. I have people from all walks on life, big and small on the podcast. My guests love the stories from every day people just as much as the in depth scientific medical conversations between doctors.

[Get In Touch](mailto:admin@drsuresh.com.au) and we can discuss how to get you on to the show.
