summary: "Having problems with poop on the carnivore diet? You need to watch this. In today's episode we are discussing poop. That's right. GI issues on the Carnivore Diet. It happens and we have to acknowledge it. I believe many, if not most people get some issue with their bowels at the start, but usually it's pretty easily resolved. Like others I had a few issues when starting on the carnivore diet, particularly with constipation, but it was pretty easily resolved by adding in more fat."
