# Transcript

## Intro

Welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## My Health Journey

I guess a good place to start is why I
made this podcast. Now I've recently converted to a
carnivore diet
and when I say I converted I really mean
converted.
I'd always eaten quite a lot of meat,
always drawn to it. Whilst like anyone of course I enjoyed
sugary foods I was never really that
drawn to them.
I would usually prefer savory rather
than sweet foods.

I'd usually prefer a steak than a
chocolate cake for example
but like many I just struggle to not eat
sugar. ow it's hard it's everywhere
but as a doctor
I know the importance of diet and
nutrition
and so I was determined to live a healthy
life, after all
not many patients really want to see or
take advice from an unhealthy overweight
doctor. Now I cover my own personal
health yourney in
a little more detail in my other podcast
quest for health _(I never made this podcast)_
but briefly -
I've almost always been overweight and
unhealthy it pains me to say it but it's
true. My issue started when I was maybe around
10 to 11 years old and feeling
overweight.
I remember my parents telling me back
then it was just puppy fat and it would
go away -
and it did -
but it came back with a vengeance.
I remember always being conscious of my
body and my fat, but
thankfully though I never developed any
Eating Disorders at least that I know of
but I was always unhappy with my body. Over the years I did almost every type
of diet going and whilst I got some
success,
I was never really happy. If I was fat I wanted to lose weight. When I was skinny I wanted to bulk up
and gain muscle,
but nothing ever really worked.

I was never really happy and I wonder if
I was even that healthy or simply just
getting away with it because I was
younger.

I remember being in my 20s spending
hours in the gym every day.
I used to get up at like 5 a.m to go to
the gym before work.
I was pounding food and supplements
because of course that's what it took to
build muscle.
Whilst I did get stronger,
I never really built any muscle
and I did everything I was meant to.
I tried getting up at
5am to go to the gym every day for an
hour.
I tried eating all the time seven times
a day didn't work.
I tried eating three times a day that
didn't work.
I tried carbs.
I tried no carbs tried cars before
working out during after nothing seemed
to really work.
I did the exact amount of you know
dextrose maltodextrose glucose bananas
everything after the workout mixing it
with all sorts of stuff the list was
endless.
But nothing ever worked. It was just so demoralizing and I just I
just wanted to give up,
and of course life happened you know
responsibility, marriage, kids
you just don't have the time to spend
hours in the gym anymore
and honestly I didn't really want to
anyway because I wasn't seeing any
results.

I'd resigned myself to being overweight
and actually
sadly became okay with that. Thinking back as much as we celebrate
body positivity - and rightly so -
we are in danger of in society of
normalizing and almost celebrating
obesity
and being unhealthy,
and to be honest I was guilty of that. I
accepted and normalized me being
unhealthy.

I just didn't know any better.

Now over the next few years I bounced
around with my health yo-yo dieting. Losing and gaining weight all the time.

I'd finished medical school, done my GP
training and had moved to Australia to
escape England and the NHS -
but anybody that knows the NHS will
understand why.

## Intermittent fasting

My own personal medical Journey continued and whilst I was a doctor and
looked okay,
I was still unhappy and unhealthy. In this time I tried almost everything
except intermittent fasting.
I remember thinking intermittent fasting
was just a fad and nothing good would
come from it,
but a patient actually got me to try it.

I will forever be grateful to him for
starting me down on this path and just
as a side note here, **I do think as doctors we should listen
to our patients much much more than we
actually do**.

I've learned a lot from my patients over
the years and I really wish more doctors
would actually listen to their patients
and try and learn.

Anyway
I remember him talking to me about
intermittent fasting,
and fasting in general but specifically
about prolonged fasting. Now he wanted to do a seven day fast.

Now of course I just couldn't correlate this
at all with my medical training,
and so you know dutifully of course I
told him

> You are insane and you'll probably
> die. I can't support it and I'd
> have nothing to do with it -
> and you should probably go and see a
> different doctor who specialized in this
> work.

Now I wasn't rude about it of course,
I said all of this nicely and professionally
but the message was kind of still the
same.

The reply basically back was

> "nope
> you're my doctor
> so you're gonna help me"

Now after a lot of back and forth eventually I agreed to monitor him
because I wanted to make sure he was
being safe,
and of course he was fine. But not just fine -
his results were actually astounding.

### Almost all of the issues that he had disappeared within a week or so. My mind was absolutely blown.

How could not eating
be healthy
how could not eating be helpful
to the body. This
just made no sense to me.
I was absolutely intrigued. Sadly though of course my medical
training just
stopped me from accepting this,
though I did eventually agree to reading
a couple of the books on fasting that he
wanted me to.

Now I'm glad I did this because
I still couldn't accept not eating for a
week was going to be healthy,
but I started to realize that there was
more to this fasting business than just
not eating calories like I thought.

So eventually
I started actually doing intermittent
fasting myself -
after all it was the only thing that I
hadn't really tried before
and I have to say my results were
amazing.

For the first time in my life I actually
really felt in control of my food and my
eating more so than when I've been doing
Keto, Lifestyle Medicine and plant based nutrition,
and I was losing weight and mostly
keeping it off.

My biomarkers for health were all
improving as well which was great.

## Lifestyle Medicine

Now this all started me on this journey
and almost instantly I actually
undertook my board certification in Lifestyle Medicine.

Now people say you should spend years
studying that but I was so fascinated I
was just spending hours every day
researching and learning and I just
jumped into the exam.

I actually passed my exam and became
board certified.
I was truly fascinated that diet and
nutrition could play such a huge role in
people's health
and was truly now able to help my
patients by preventing their disease not
just managing it.

Now of course some out there will know
that the lifestyle medicine
heavily pushes plant-based nutrition
but this is a carnivore podcast.

Okay yes
I don't agree with plant-based nutrition
I've done it before myself
and I felt terrible.

I see a lot of people who feel terrible
on plant-based diets. Interestingly I've
never seen a patient on carnivore feel
terrible.

> I don't agree with plant-based nutrition. I didn't agree with it then and I remember you know having to do the
> exam and
> unfortunately, like a lot of things like
> in medical school (this is definitely a
> problem as well)
> you kind of just have to learn the exam,
> not the truth.

I didn't Advocate Advocate plant-based
diets but I did used to advocate plant
heavy diets, just not entirely
plant-based. I think it's okay to not agree with
everything that you're taught
and I do believe that an inquisitive
mind is a healthy mind. We're actually taught this in medical
school. We're not taught a great deal at medical
school but some things we are taught are
really good and I remember being taught
very early on to question what we were
being taught,
to question research, to question studies
and not just take them on Blind Faith.

## Introduction To Carnivore

fast
forward a year or so and this patient
basically tells me he's doing a hyper
carnivore diet. Now obviously again my medical brain
just could not accept this.

> It was like a AI and a logic trap just
> spinning in circles
> unable to find the solution

At least though at this point I was a
little bit more open-minded and agreed
to monitor him like
before. Now of course all of his biomarkers
improved,
but not just that his medical issues
just
completely melted away.

I was absolutely fascinated
but again I just
I couldn't accept that this was good.

### I mean fruit and veg are good. Aren't

they?

It's drummed into us from birth that we
must eat our vegetables -
we must just grit our teeth and think of
England whilst we swallow these
foul-tasting things. Indeed I just spent all of this time
learning about all these extra things
about plant-based nutrition and how the
this diet plant-based diet can fix the
world and all these studies that show
benefit.

You know through all this time I
actually never stopped believing that meat
was good for us, just that perhaps it
should coexist with plant nutrition.

> I'd always eaten a lot of meat
> and to be honest never really been a
> massive fan of vegetables.

So I actually started researching more
and I found that, yeah, like maybe there's
something in it, but I couldn't bring
myself to cut out all vegetables and
fruit. You know after all these these
were good for me and these were just
people on the internet talking about it.

#My Awakening

So
then I went to low carb Down Under 2022.
and that was amazing and if there's
anyone that ever gets a chance to go I
imagine KetoCon in the states is
very similar you should definitely go.

Anyway I listened to a talk by the
amazing Dr Anthony Chaffee the plant free
MD - and definitely check out his podcast
it is is truly amazing I've learned a
lot from him-
but suddenly my mind was blown
not that meat was good - I knew that - but
that _plants could be bad._

Hang on hang on. Plants are bad? That just can't be right?
everything that we're told - plants are
amazing this can't be right
this was an absolute paradigm shift I
just couldn't compute.

It wasn't just that I didn't have to eat that salad, but
actually maybe I didn't want to eat that
salad maybe it was actually bad for me
to eat it.

But this kind of was just unbelievable.

Yet completely believable. Something about it just made sense. After all I mean we know that you can't
just eat random plants in the forest

- that'll probably kill you.

You can't just go and like eat water
hemlock, it'll kill you within minutes.

You know you go and eat a couple of
bitter almonds you know Peach pits
you'll probably die. You go and eat a cassava plant, cassava
melon and don't prepare it right you'll die.

So it's not that much of a stretch to
think that plants actually have toxins
in that could affect us.
Now after all just look at things like
caffeine,
cannabis, mushrooms. All of these things these psychoactive
agents
they clearly have a role. They clearly
have a function on our body physically
and mentally,
so it's not that much of a stretch.

So I pretty much just said there and
then

> well you know what let's try it
> there's this doctor who's doing this now
> he's been doing it for 20 odd years
> and he looks great and he says he feels
> amazing and it's someone in the flesh
> actually talking to me this is an
> Australian doctor this is not just some
> random on the internet that's talking to
> me about it

[![30 Day Challenge - how to start a carnivore diet](/static/images/blog/30daychallenge.webp)](https://bit.ly/3lSmkji)

So my mind was basically made up. You know I thought I'll try for a couple of
weeks see what happens. What's the worst
that happens in two weeks?
I'm not gonna die in two weeks
and I just figured you know what I'll go
cold turkey.
I'll just go off everything coffee,
alcohol although I didn't really drink
much anyway,
but no herbs no spices no plants at all.

I wanted to really really do it if I was
going to do it.

## Benefits Of Carnivore Diet

I was scared,
but I was motivated,
but
my God the difference in two barely two
days,
probably a day and a half.

> I felt oh my God amazing I just it's
> hard to explain I just felt alive
> truly alive.

Now I'd gone from doing intermittent
fasting and keto diet combination which
is about as good as you can really get
for health,
but even compared to this,
it was just night and day.

I felt just incredible. My energy just knew no bounds. My mental health was just out of this
world.

Now I really kind of never really had
any mental health issues maybe, but in
retrospect now I felt like I kind of
just had depression and anxiety all my
life.

I was just stress-free.

I was euphoric.

Like nothing could touch me.

I almost felt like I was just floating
on clouds.

Now we were actually going through quite
stressful time at that point my wife and
I are in our family, not relationship
wise just you know life,
but I'd gone from kind of actually
worrying about it most days to just
like I just had a Teflon Shield like
it was just bouncing off me.

Like I wasn't dude it's not like I
didn't care,
it just didn't affect me. I could just
deal with it. It's amazing.

I was clear-headed Clarity.
Just energy, and for the first time in
probably forever, I just woke up refreshed alert
ready to start the day.

I didn't have to scrape myself out of
bed.

From there the improvements just kept
clocking up my fatigue was just gone my
tiredness was gone
my mood so much better
my stress had just disappeared like I
said I just had this Teflon Shield of
just
stress barrier like nothing could stress
me at all.

I was motivated. Genuinely motivated to
do things clean tidy fix things around
the house, do the washing, do the laundry
, do the ironing like the dishwasher like
the house was just spotless in days and
if you know me in my house,
um we're not the cleanest of people,
but you know I wanted to do this. Genuinely I wanted to learn, research,
improve my knowledge. I wanted to just be fit and healthy. I
wanted to live.

I wanted to be in nature and experience
the world and care for the planet
more than I've ever done before. It's just so hard to explain.

My wife definitely noticed the
improvement in me immediately.

Now that was around three months ago and
I haven't looked back since. In that time I've researched and I've
learned a whole lot more,
and I wanted to make this podcast to
introduce patients to carnivore and
share what I've learned.

Of course
I'm still learnin and I'm not going to pretend like I know
everything about Carnivore. God no.
But I'm gonna try and I want to
take you guys on the journey with me.

I've also introduced a few patients to
carnivore diet
and every single one has found great
success with issues like irritable bowel
syndrome you know for 20 to 30 years just
being cured. Colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis
depression, anxiety, stress, tiredness
fatigue, arthritis, you name it it's got
better.

Even some conditions like bipolar
disorders and schizophrenia these patients
are improving for the first time.

I had a
patient the other day say

> for the first
> time in 30 years she feels alive and she
> wants to be alive. All from the carnivore diet.

I mean unless you've got those
conditions or you're managing these with
patients with these things you've got no
idea what that means to these people
and from just simply not eating plants.

It's just incredible. Even the patients that haven't managed to
go all that way to carnivore
every single patient that I've seen
that I've advised them and they've
agreed to eat more red meat red meat
specifically, they've felt better
and this actually correlates with a
study in 2022 from Harvard University
where they looked at just over 2 000
patients who did the carnivore diet.

It was an observational study
so okay look it gets some criticism,
because this is not the best quality of
study it's not a randomized control
trial or a meta-analysis,
but about 95% of people reported only
positive outcomes on Carnivore diet
about 2 000 people, just over 2 000
people. That's just unheard of.

I don't know a single study that's ever
come close to that yes okay it's an
observational study,
but it's just incredible people were
curing incurable illnesses again,
self-reported, but why would people lie.

They have no reason to lie they weren't
being paid for this study,
just curing themselves of diabetesm
chronic bowel problems, I mean all of
these things just incredible,
so there's really been no denying that
it can help people and yes maybe it's
anecdote but still
in the last three months or so you know
I've been doing this with myself and
I've learned enormous amounts and my
world's been turned upside down,
and I've been helping my patients with
this as well. If they want to do it, but of
course I'm not pushing it on them
but it's really interesting because
despite research showing that red meat is
bad
there's clearly no denying that it's
caused great benefit for me and my
patients.

That's really interesting because
actually, I mean I'll cover this in
another episode but you look at the
World Health organization's own data on
red me causing bowel cancer for example
they use 15 studies
seven less than half
showed a weak association with bowel
cancer
eight more than half
showed absolutely no association with
bowel cancer. Despite this they concluded that red meat caused cancer.

Sorry but you cannot draw that conclusion because
more studies said there definitely was
not a link then the studies that said
there might be a very weak link
one might think maybe there's an agenda
that they're trying to fill.

I even had a vegan and a vegetarian
patient agreed to eat more meat. They
instantly felt better,
and now they're questioning that a whole
previous life as non-meateaters and
they've actually gone and told their
friends and family about eating more
meat because there's the difference in
how they feel.

Now don't get me wrong
a lot of people like to eat more meat
but not everyone,
and for some it's almost impossible to
come to terms with,
even faced with the knowledge that their
diet is pretty awful and it's causing
their harm.

Some people just struggle to accept that
eating more meat and not plants could be
good for them.

Some people sadly are addicted to just
bad food and and I understand that. Sugar and
carbs there is an addiction, it's very
hard to break it
so you know some people need a little
bit more gentle coaching.

I've also had a few, um,
spirited conversations let's say with
some vegan patients who have accused me
of misinformation and spreading lies.

Despite what you might think I actually
enjoy these conversations mostly because
they're useful conversations I'm always
keen to learn,
but unfortunately you know the research
and evidence they use to justify their
arguments is almost always flawed, biased
or just of extremely low quality
never showing causation
and often barely correlation - yet
presented as fact. It's actually quite ironic that those
are the ones most likely spreading
misinformation and unproven claims
yet they actually really struggle to
accept it.

I'm absolutely loving it and telling
everybody to eat more red meat but
others sadly are entrenched and I've had
people resort to childish name calling
or worse personal threats.

> I think if you're having to threaten
> someone
> to get your point across,
> well that's pretty sad and you probably
> don't have a good basis for your
> arguments if you're having to resort to
> threats.
> not only do you lose all credibility you,
> just make a fool of yourself,
> and of course you're threatening people

I'm always Keen to learn and have
conversations with people
you know I want to learn and I'm happy
to engage with anyone that wants to have
a actual grown-up conversation about
diet and nutrition.

In the meantime you know I continued to
research and learn more
and I want to share that knowledge that.

I've learned so that others can learn
with me,
and together we can improve our physical
and mental health
through a species appropriate diet
the right nutrition
but I believe that means eating more
meat.

## Conclusion

If you are
looking for a guide as I said I do have
a guide available on a kind of or Diet
Link in the description down below
but basically for most people you don't
really need a guide it's pretty
intuitive eating eat when you're hungry
don't eat when you're not eat what your
body is telling you to eat if your
body's telling you to eat beef eat the
beef if you open up the fridge and the
chicken looks good eat the chicken if
your pork looks good eat the pork it's
pretty simple straightforward you're not
going to go that far wrong with doing
that approach
