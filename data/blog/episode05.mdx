# How can low carb help you? Interview with Low Carb GP Dr Avi Charlton - Episode 05

## Intro

Welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## Coming soon

Coming Soon!

## Conclusion

But I personally think
if you're eating intuitively
you'll likely be occasionally fasting
naturally and I don't think forcing
intermittent fasting on top
is required. If you want to do intermittent fasting,
go ahead there's no harm, but
I really wouldn't worry about it at all.
