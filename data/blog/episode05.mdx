# Transcript

## Intro

Welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## Background

In the last episode I went into a little
bit more detail about my carnivore
journey but in this episode I wanted to
discuss more about fasting on the
carnivore diet.

Is it needed? Or is it harmful?

Let's start by talking about
intermittent fasting -
what is it and why is it useful?

## What is intermittent fasting?

Now I'm going to cover this in much more
detail in another episode, really going
into the detail about fasting so if you
want a more detailed explanation join my [membership program](/community) if you want access to that.

So intermittent fasting is basically
restricting your eating to a certain
time window. It's sometimes called time restricted
eating and usually it's done by skipping
breakfast and possibly lunch. You also need to skip anything really
that will cause your insulin to jump so,
you can't just have a milky coffee and
then skip breakfast,
then you're not really doing fasting. You're actually really just not eating
and then you will probably get some
issues.

Some people say you can do
a Bulletproof Coffee whilst fasting -
that's having fat or oil in your coffee -
no milk or just eating butter.

I don't do these as they will break a fast most likely, although I'm not 100 sure about that one I
don't think it's been studied to my
knowledge.

If you really wanted to test it well
you could do a fasting insulin and then
eat butter and then repeat the fasting
insulin test. This will tell you if it's going to break a fast or not.
We know fat doesn't really raise insulin
at all so butter shouldn't do much
but it probably will do a little because
butter does still have some protein and
a little bit of sugar, although not much,
it could be enough to technically break
the fast.

Realistically it's probably fine.

Now some people do 16 hour fasts, some do
18, some 20 and so on.

Some like the patient I saw the other
day does alternate day fasting. There's
really no set pattern that you have to
follow you just do what works for you.

## Why bother fasting at all?

Why bother with restricting your eating times?
Well the real reason we want to fast is
to reduce our insulin resistance,
primarily our insulin levels
and put us into a so-called fasted state. The fasting state refers to the
metabolism switching over from glucose
and carbs to ketones and fat,
possibly protein, though likely only in a
starvation setting. This is the opposite of what we call the
FED state in which we use glucose as
fuel.

Now I disagree with these definitions
and I know others out there do as well.

> I believe our natural state is the
> fasting state
> you just have to look at babies the vast
> majority of the time they're actually in
> nutritional ketosis

Look at almost every other animal on the
planet maybe even all of them I'm not
sure entirely,
they mostly use fatty acids as fuel,
even for example cows eating grass -
they're not really actually eating the
carbohydrates they're not actually
getting the cellulose directly,
they're actually absorbing fatty acids
which are produced by bacteria that feed
on the cellulose in the grass. So they're actually using fat as fuel
not carbs (not the grass).

So what happens when we get into this
so-called fasted state? Well our insulin rather is as
low as possible and the longer that goes
for, the longer the fasting goes for, the
lower our insulin resistance will go,
which is a good thing.

Our insulin sensitivity also increases
which is good as well. The low insulin environment will also
trigger autophagy.

## Autophagy and Leptin

Autophagy is the body's repair and
recycle mechanisms and is essential
for proper maintenance of the body,
and we want to be having this. In our fasted State we can also unblock
the hormone leptin and start to utilize
our fat stores. Leptin is primarily produced from our
fat cells and it basically tells the
brain that you've had enough fat already
and it doesn't need to make any more, and
you don't need to eat more. So in our fasted state the brain can
actually see our fat stores and utilize
them.

Insulin will really block both of these
mechanisms. Once we can use our fat we have almost
endless supply of energy.

So the average human being has around
600 grams of stored carbs glycogen in
the liver and muscle,
that equates to approximately 2400
calories (as one gram of carbs is about
four calories in energy). Now compare that to your fat stores.
I couldn't really find any hard data on
the average body fat percentage, but given around 70% of American
adults are obese the chances are it's
going to be pretty high, so yes yes I'd said 70% that is a
ridiculously high number I will put a
link to the paper that I got this from,
but yeah that's a pretty accurate number
actually.

Let's just use
my approximate body weight and fat
percentage
around 70 kilograms and roughly 25
percent
so that means I have around 17 and a
half kilograms of fat. Fat is around 9 calories per gram so
that means my fat stores are around 157000 calories as potential energy stored
in my fat. Just a little bit more than the 2400 we
have stored as carbs.

But if your insulin is high it's
pretty much literally locking away your
fat stores and you can't actually use
them.

Now I couldn't really find any evidence
to back this up, but my theory is that
this is what the runner's Second Wind
really is - it's really your body unlocking
your fat stores.

Most people have experienced this at
some point - you're pretty exhausted with
exercise you're barely able to keep
going, but you you kind of keep pushing through
and then somehow you get this energy out
of nowhere and we call that second wind. Suddenly you can seem to just carry on
easily and almost go forever. You may be not exactly as fast as you
were but you're pretty close, but seemingly just endless energy.

And my theory here
is that your insulin has been forced way
down through the exercise and just
burning the glucose and now suddenly you
can actually unlock your fat stores. I think it's a good theory at least
and I'd love to be proven correct or
wrong. To be fair if anyone out there
knows any data on this look please let
me know.

## Fasting vs FED

So anyway it sounds like we kind of want
to be in this fasted state all the time,
surely? Why is it called the fasted state in the
first place? Well really this just refers to when we
were originally looking at this and we
have the FED State versus the fasted
state. Now the FED state was basically when
people were eating carbohydrates so the
insulin was high and we really thought
this was actually the normal diet. All the time we all thought this was a
normal metabolism so we called that fed
and we call the opposite fasting.

So do we want to be in a fasted state
all the time? Well I would argue that we should and I
know that others argue that as well,
but we don't need to fast all the time.

I mean you can't fast all the time. You
can't just never eat,
you will probably eventually die,
which is not good!

Now the longest fast on record I think
is around 387 days I believe Angus
Barbeiri, a Scottish man. I'll cover that
again in another episode but I wouldn't
recommend you fast for 387 days.

So we can't fast all the time but we can
be in the fasted state the whole time.

So how come?

## Fasting mimicking.

Well we said that it's a _fasted_ state
not fasting state. The fasted state is when our insulin is
low.

Now one of the best ways to drop your
insulin level is to follow a low carb
diet like keto or carnivore. Carnivore is an almost zero carb way of
eating and will keep you in the fastest
state the vast majority of the time.

Now keto should do the same,
so the question is do we need to fast as
well as doing carnivore diet?

Well sadly there's no real studies that
have looked at this specific question at
least that I could find,
but many people believe you don't need
to because your body really is already
in the fastest State due to the low
insulin levels that you're in, and you are
really already getting almost all of the
benefits.

Now this is really evidenced I think
by studies on the fasting mimicking diet
which really was specifically designed
to emulate fasting in a long-term,
sustainable way and gives very similar
results to fasting.

Now what's another word for a fasting
mimicking diet? The ketogenic diet!

Carnivore is a form of ketogenic diet
and we'll be putting us in the fasted
state the vast vast majority of the time,
if not pretty much all the time.
Given that we're already in the
fasted state, whilst it's possible,
I think it's unlikely that extra fasting
is going to have a significant impact.

## Natural fasting?

Now many that do carnivore are really
actually naturally fasting anyway
because they really don't eat when they're not hungry. Some suggest we should specifically add
fasting both intermittent and prolonged
therapeutic fasting like maybe five or
even seven days. I've even seen some people saying
they regularly do 30 day fasts, even I
think I saw one person saying they did
42-day fasts every three months
**I mean that's like fasting 42 days on 42
days off 42 days on I mean it's
ridiculous. It's totally excessive and completely
not required.**

Now I believe anyway there's barely any
benefits Beyond seven days other than
simply the calorie reduction from not
eating,
and there are significant risks but if
you want to learn more about prolonged
fasting I will be doing an episode on
this as well so do make sure you
subscribe to my podcast.

So I think the real question here is you
know do I think forced intermittent fasting is
required on the carnivore diet?

No.

Is it helpful?

Absolutely.

## Conclusion

But I personally think
if you're eating intuitively
you'll likely be occasionally fasting
naturally and I don't think forcing
intermittent fasting on top
is required. If you want to do intermittent fasting,
go ahead there's no harm, but
I really wouldn't worry about it at all.
