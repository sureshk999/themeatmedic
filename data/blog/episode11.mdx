summary: 'Rory had struggled with acne all his life until he found the animal based diet. Since then he has found his acne was cured, his mental health improved, his libido became stronger, his dandruff disappeared, and he just feels amazing. Best of all, Rory used to be a vegetarian and was sick on that diet. He now extols the virtues of an animal based diet and teaches other people about this with his friends.'
