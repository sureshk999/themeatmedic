summary: "Like many others Adaure became somewhat disillusioned with the standard medical system, especially the habit of short quick consults and rushing for prescribing.

Dr Adaure soon realised it was better for her to become a health coach and has left mainstream General Practice, in part due to the risk and fear of being punished for _daring to help patients_ by spending longer with them. This is a concern many of us doing this work share."
