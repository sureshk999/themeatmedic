# AI-Generated Diet Plan: Shocking Results from Chat GPT - Ep 31

## Intro

Hi guys and welcome to another episode of the Meatt Medic Podcast. Today I'm going
to be talking about what I eat on a carnivore diet.

I get asked this a lot by patients by people on YouTube comments, the community, my Discord server and so
I thought it'd be quite a good idea to make a video talking
about it. It's pretty simple really, basically carnivore diet is an all meat diet pretty
much and all animal based foods.

I primarily prioritize beef now. Most people talk about ruminant animals being the priority really on Carnivore. I think
that's absolutely true and we generally want to be focusing prioritizing on the fatty cuts of meat carnivore diet. A lot of people find great success with it - weight loss, nutrition, anti-inflammatory diet, improving autoimmune conditions. I mean you know
pretty much you name it people will tell you that it's improved on the carnivore
diet and I have absolutely no reason to suspect that they are lying.

I've seen
amazing success with it myself and if you're interested in a step-by-step
guide on how to do a carnivore diet if you're not doing it already check out my
[30-day guide on how to start a carnivore diet](https://bit.ly/3lSmkji).

[![30 Day Challenge - how to start a carnivore diet](/static/images/blog/30daychallenge.webp)](https://bit.ly/3lSmkji)

So the carnivore diet is an all meat, zero carb diet and it holds a lot of promise - a lot of potential.
Now anecdotes yes there's no big studies but pretty much
everybody that does the carnivore diet says they just feel absolutely
incredible so if you're new here to the channel don't forget to hit the

mash and share this video to your friends if you found it very useful let
me know in the comments down below what you're eating on a carnivore diet

Anyway let's Jump Right In.

## Breakfast

Pretty much when I eat breakfast -
actually often I don't - I did do an
episode on [fasting on a carnivore diet](/episode07)
if you're interested in that. Generally I
eat intuitively - so I eat when I'm hungry.
I don't eat if I'm not hungry and most
days I actually skip breakfast. When I eat breakfast I
like to keep it very very simple:
basically either eggs or steak
pretty much. That's it.

I will
occasionally eat bacon but I don't eat that
much bacon - I've actually kind of gone
off the taste of bacon a little bit
which is kind of weird because like
everyone loves bacon. Steak
varies but typically something like
T-bone, porterhouse, ribeye - we really
really want to prioritize the fatty
cuts of meat and I don't have huge time
in the morning so I just fry up
something really quickly. I'm not going
to sit there for three hours braising a
chuck for example. I usually cook them in
beef Tallow lard butter I use a lot of
butter and Tallow here, bacon grease we
do have leftover bacon grease in the
freezer and so on I do use that,
otherwise the eggs I basically just cook
up how I like them.

I do like poaching my
eggs - I _love_ a poached egg on top of a
steak - oh my God so good I actually use
[this poaching
thing](https://amzn.to/3Mla0lG) - it's pretty simple actually
bought it off Amazon I think it's like
15 Australian dollars. It's very simple
basically you know a few pieces here
very simple amazing for poaching eggs
absolutely perfect for poaching eggs
definitely worth getting if you're a fan
of Poached Eggs otherwise look I just
basically fry them up, shallow fry them
scramble them whatever don't really care
just eat the eggs. My kids like eating
scrambled eggs so I generally just
scramble them, but they do love poached eggs
as well so that poacher is really coming in handy. Otherwise let's move.

## Lunch

Now actually I often miss lunch
again uh I just don't feel that I need
it very often. Most of the time I'm doing
one meal a day or two meals a day - I
actually often do breakfast and just
dinner I just skipped the lunch I find
it just works for me work wise and
everything but you know if I am hungry
usually I'll take in something like a
steak, I either just eat it cold or we
actually have an air fryer in the
coffee room at my work so I can always
air fry it there. Cold steak is honestly
really nice like a just a cooked rib eye
just take it in eat it cold so delicious
otherwise if I'm out and about look I
might go to macca's and get like a
burger patty or something, but honestly
I work in shopping complexes I just go
to the to the supermarket like
Woolworths and just go go to the deli
counter and I just get something like the shaved
beef. So today I went to the deli counter
because I was a bit hungry at lunchtime -
I bought some roast beef, I bought some
leg ham and I bought some pastrami beef
pretty simple pretty straightforward I
bought some silver side as well actually
about 100 grams of each of them so I
think I had something like 400 grams 500
grams in total. Yes there's cheaper
options than the deli counter absolutely
but in a pinch it's perfectly good definitely
way better than going and buying garbage
that's for sure.

## Dinner

Otherwise then dinner is
usually where I eat most of my food if
I'm doing one meal a day it's almost
always gonna be dinner if I'm eating two
meals a day it's gonna include dinner. Dinner is almost invariably steak
there's just no two ways about it beef
is the best. There's really just no doubt about it we
do definitely want to prioritize ruminant animals on the carnivore diet and we
definitely want those fatty cuts of meat -
so we're generally not going to things
like pork we're generally not going to
things like chicken because whilst these
can be fatty like pork it has a very
high omega-6 content and it isn't ideal
every once in a while I will eat it. Absolutely I do think variety is
important psychologically and physically
but I'm just not eating it all the time. Beef is what I'm eating 99 percent of the time
. If I'm not eating that I'm probably
eating homemade chicken nuggets - very
very simple recipe I'll do a video at
some point on recipes basically very
very simple you basically get pork
crackling - as good as you can make it - oh
sorry you know those like in in like the
packets pork crackling packet as good as
you can get it ideally cooked in its own
juices but it's hard to find that I know,
basically get a pestle and mortar, then mix it all up make it into a crumb. Roll the chicken in that, stick it in the
[Air Fryer](https://amzn.to/3TZiX6v) - 20 minutes job done absolutely
amazing. My kids absolutely love that as
well, definitely goes down a treat. Occasionally I will eat maybe some lamb
chops but as I said pretty much almost
always
basically steak - I actually have some
leftover ribeye I'm eating here cold
from the other night. I'm just eating
as a snack.

## Snacks

Actually snacks that's a good
point so snacks - like I very rarely eat
snacks actually but if I do look
honestly it's yeah like it's cold ribeye
or something or also got a cup of [bone broth](https://amzn.to/3BgxNgz) uh bone broth as well is
definitely a good snack. Homemade Jerky
like anything like this is all
basically good as well. Carnivore diet is
very simple it's basically like bone
broth and beef it's it's pretty simple
it's not rocket science.

## Conclusion

If you are
looking for a guide as I said I do have
a guide available on a kind of or Diet
Link in the description down below
but basically for most people you don't
really need a guide it's pretty
intuitive eating eat when you're hungry
don't eat when you're not eat what your
body is telling you to eat if your
body's telling you to eat beef eat the
beef if you open up the fridge and the
chicken looks good eat the chicken if
your pork looks good eat the pork it's
pretty simple straightforward you're not
going to go that far wrong with doing
that approach
