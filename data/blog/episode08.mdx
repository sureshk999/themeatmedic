# What does intuitive eating really mean? (and why you shouldn't eat if not hungry) Episode 08

## Intro

Welcome to the Meat Medic Podcast. I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## What is it?

welcome to the meek medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh kawadka I'm a GP and
lifestyle physician and I'm a practicing
Carnival
I've had great success myself and with
patience by following a carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about how
to achieve Optimal Health through diet
nutrition and lifestyle changes
in today's episode I want to discuss
intuitive eating and what it means
I say discussed a lot on the Carnival
forums eating till satiety but what does
this actually mean
A patient with loss of appetite
now I recently saw a patient who was
concerned that they weren't so sometimes
just weren't hungry and this really
actually was concerning them a lot
they were worried that this was somehow
abnormal and that they should always
feel hungry or at least want to eat
really large meals
now of course my medical trading took
over and took me straight to thoughts
like cancer bowel disease and so on
thankfully of course after a
comprehensive consultation there weren't
any issues found and I was able to
reassure my patient and use the
opportunity to discuss the diet and
metabolic health
I questioned why they thought it was a bad thing that they sometimes just
weren't hungry
they've got me thinking a bit about
intuitive eating it's something I
discuss a lot with my patients and it's
something I've personally become a lot
more in tune with since starting the
carnivore diet
so what is intuitive eating
What is intuitive eating?
on the website intuitiveeating.org they
talk about the 10 principles of
intuitive eating so I think that's a
good place to start
so to talk about rejecting diet
mentality
honoring hunger making peace with food
challenging the food police discovering
satisfaction
feeling fullness
coping with emotions with kindness and
not food
respecting your body
movement and honoring your health
now you can read the website but what
does this actually all mean
well in a nutshell it means not
restricting foods and stop looking for
quick fixes
respecting being hungry understanding
what it means accepting the food is okay
and it's nutrition for the body
understanding that we aren't good or bad
depending on the food that we eat
learning our satiety signals and when we
don't need any more food
and accepting our body as long as we are
healthy
think all very good advice on the whole
but what does this actually mean in real
Real life meaning?
life
well we all know there's no quick fixes
when it comes to nutrition and diet
the idea that we are what we eat does
actually have some Merit but it's not as
simple as we'll eat fat in your beef fat
in fact it's often quite the opposite
fat consumption generally helps us to
lose weight
but if you eat garbage well you probably
will be garbage
there's really not much way around that
some people are more tolerant than
others of bad food but bad food will
inevitably lead to bad health I mean
it's pretty much a fact of life
I do agree though with the idea of not
going on yo-yo diets repeated dieting
because they can cause more harm than
good
and generally people whose cereal diet
will gain weight over time and end up
with more health problems as a result of
the food that they consume
now I actually somewhat disagree about
restricting Foods though
restricting Foods I think can be a good
Restrictive eating and cheat meals
thing but of course we have to be
sensible about it
restrictive eating isn't necessarily A
Bad Thing
it's not healthy to say well
you could eat as much ice cream as you
like
you'll never be healthy if that's all
you eat
eating a little bit of ice cream isn't
going to kill you
but it also isn't really healthy for you
okay
if it helps you to maintain your Healthy
nutrition and health goals by providing
you at least some psychological relief
you know otherwise known as cheat meals
I think that's okay
it's a lot of evidence this actually can
be very beneficial for some people
now some people say carnivore diet is
incredibly restrictive because of just
the narrow diet
and I hear a lot of people patients have
come to see me saying that they they
just they can't do low carb they can't
do keto because it's just oh it's too
restrictive
but I actually disagree with that
statement I don't feel it's restrictive
at all
because I'm eating the food that I want
to eat
how can that possibly be restrictive
I think it's only restrictive if you're
if you aren't eating the food that you
want to eat
so if you really want to eat ice cream
and you not you can't eat ice cream well
that is a restrictive diet
the real question though is
why do you want to eat the ice cream in
the first place if you know it's bad for
you
how can that be good to eat bad food
look maybe a little cheat here and there
can help you but
we've got to accept I think that some
food actually just is bad for us
so the next big part of course is
listening to our hunger signals
now the website actually says in this
Carbohydrates
part that carbs are good and I pretty
much completely disagree with that
external or exogenous carbohydrates are
factually shown to be non-essential to
life which means you don't ever need to
eat carbohydrates
but I digress slightly
listening to our hunger signals really
does actually mean what it sounds like
listening to your body and understanding
Hunger, leptin and insulin
what hunger is
So Hunger is defined as an uncomfortable
sensation caused by insufficient dietary
energy
now that's a pretty bland kind of
statement really but it basically means
that you know it's not nice to to be
hungry and you probably need to eat
it's not a cue though that you need to
just go and Gorge yourself immediately
or that you'll somehow die if you don't
get that food but it does sometimes feel
like that
if it feels like that and you're getting
hungry and so forth it's probably
because your hormone leptin is being
blocked
leptin is produced by fat cells and
essentially tells your brain hey I've
got enough fat already don't worry about
it you're not starving
this hormone can be pretty effectively
blocked by insulin which of course is
produced primarily through the ingestion
of carbohydrates and sugars
it's kind of the equivalent of your
brain having one of those really big
kind of you know dog cones on and you
can't see the rest of its body
if you can't see your energy stores as
soon as your stomach is empty it thinks
you're gonna die because well it's empty
and it's got no fuel
he took a high carbohydrate diet will
block leptin and make your hunger
signals completely screwed up
and so it will make you feel like you
need to eat immediately and Gorge
yourself or you'll die
now it's kind of like leptin's kind of
like the fuel gauge in your car and your
fat cells are your fuel tank
but insulin has basically just kind of
cut the fuel lines
so you've got all this this fuel
but you can't see it you can't use it
and what you end up having to do is just
constantly get out of the car and just
pull a fuel into the engine directly
it's incredibly inefficient way of
working and every five miles or whatever
you're just you're just gonna conk out
and you're gonna feel terrible
if you can get the insulin down well
basically you're re you're re-engaging
those fuel lines you're reconnecting
them
anyway a lot of people need to relearn
hunger signals when going on a low carb
diet especially carnivore because their
brain isn't actually used to the effect
of leptin they don't know what that
feels like
and some people get really hungry others
actually don't get hungry at all and
don't eat enough
now the second part of this kind of part
is learning satisfaction now this refers
Learning satisfaction
to the sensation of feeling full and
being satiated
and we don't want to eat till we're
bursting that's uncomfortable and
unpleasant
on the whole we don't even really want
to feed eat till we feel full there's a
chances are we probably actually ate too
much but eating to satiation is a
different thing altogether
it means eating until you're done
not bursting just pleasantly filled
now just like the patient in the example
earlier if you've ever eaten a meal and
halfway through you felt you know what
I'm okay I'm done
that's okay
you're eating to a satiation and
satisfaction and that's a good thing
it promotes healthy eating behavior and
it's unlikely to produce eating
disorders
this is of course not exclusive to
enjoying food
we can just totally enjoy food whilst
not overeating or indulging in unhealthy
eating behaviors
most people will tell you that eating
meat will tell you it's a great steak
it's highly enjoyable
probably more than a tub of ice cream
actually fact you're infinitely more
healthy and they aren't overeating
we don't have to eat unhealthy food to
Taste and listening to your body
feel good or enjoy the food we eat
it's a common misconception that Health
Food the healthy food tastes bad an
unhealthy food tastes good
in fact many times it's the opposite
the exception being sugar of course
because it's a drug
now we have taste buds for a reason and
it's okay it's to tell our body that
we're putting food in it and it's good
or bad for us
again with the exception of sugar if it
tastes good the chances are a body wants
it and if it tastes bad the body
probably doesn't want it
the human race has kind of just
forgotten how to listen to our own
bodies
making peace with food and honoring your
health means not beating yourself up if
you have a slight snip up
you're not going to screw your body up
if you have a sip of orange juice or a
scoop of ice cream but if you do it
repeatedly every single meal then maybe
yes you're going to have a problem but
once in a while won't really hurt
anything
you can't undo a whole day or week of
good eating and nutrition with a single
slipper so don't panic and don't blame
yourself just get back into eating in a
healthy Manner and shrug it off
Emotional eating
coping with emotions and not food is
important
emotional eating can be a major health
problem
we need to learn how to regulate our
emotions without resorting to food
now many people can sympathize with
opening a tub of ice cream when we're
feeling down or tired for that quick
dopamine hit from the sugar but it
doesn't usually last very long
quickly goes away and we're left with
feeling a feeling of guilt and emptiness
can we probably be still hungry anyway
and so we just eat more and the cycle
Case example
kind of just continues
so coming back to my patient my example
of a patient who didn't feel hungry so
what did I do with them
well of course after my medical training
kicked in and I initially jumped
straight to cancer and other healthy
health issues kind of reorganized in my
head and actually the first thing I
actually said to the patient was
why does this concern you
now this wasn't someone who never wanted
to eat he wasn't caucetic the medical
term for significantly underweight
this was someone who was a healthy BMI
in fact slightly overweight if anything
they just sometimes ate and halfway
through the bill didn't want to finish
it
so after a proper consultation
examination didn't show anything
significant of course I reassured them
and explained that actually this was all
pretty normal they were just simply
listening to their body
we went on to discuss further things
Disordered eating
around intuitive eating and listening to
hunger signals and exploring their
metabolic health
but it got me thinking
how far have we gone a society that we
think sometimes just not being hungry is
pathological
that we need to fear not being hungry or
something to worry about
that was somehow harming ourselves if
we're not full to bursting with food all
the time
and for the rest of the day I just
couldn't help thinking how crazy this is
as a society that we pathologicalize not
eating when we aren't hungry
we're so addicted to eating that we just
feel unwell when we don't eat even if
we're not even hungry
and that we worry when we're not hungry
and we need to see the doctor because
sometimes we just didn't want to eat
as perfectly acceptable not to be hungry
all the time or want to eat all the time
as a society we've created so much
disordered eating and it's hard to know
when it started really but I'd wager it
probably came in around the time of the
infamous breakfast is the most important
meal of the day line
how many times have we heard that and
it's still touted today
a simple Google search will reveal
hundreds of health sites stating this as
fact
but do you know where it came from
Kellogg's
it was a 19th century marketing campaign
to sell breakfast cereal
absolutely no evidence in health
and it just shows the power that
marketing and money has over all of our
health policies and behaviors
breakfast has never been the most
important meal of the day
break fast is but we'll cover that in
another upcoming episode on fasting
so the marketing line really creates
disordered eating and we tell our kids
and ourselves that they must eat
breakfast even if they're not hungry
now there really is the very definition
of disordered eating telling someone to
eat when they're not hungry
how can that possibly be good for
someone
how many times have we told people you
must finish everything on your plate
even if you're not hungry you must eat
it all you can't waste food
how many of our times have our parents
told us that how many times we tell our
kids that
you can't get dessert if you don't
finish your veggies
well why are we even eating dessert
every meal anyway is completely
non-essential
and why are we rewarding our kids for
eating something they don't want to eat
that's just Madness and is guaranteed to
create disordered eating
so intuitive eating is difficult but it
starts with us parents and we have to do
better to educate our kids on how and
what to eat when to eat and how to
listen to their hunger signals and
satiety signals and of course ourselves
as adults
what do I feed my kids?
now I don't have the magic answer but I
try
I'm a parent
I've got three young kids
I completely get it it's bloody annoying
when you make dinner and they don't want
to eat it and then five minutes later
they're suddenly hungry again
now I'm not immune to that
half time my kids don't even eat their
food and then they just want to go and
eat something five minutes later
sometimes food gets wasted
and it sucks but
I tried to listen to them
I make them food a selection of food
usually and I kind of just put it on the
table they pick what they want and they
eat how much they want
now when we first started doing this it
was kind of just chaos but over time
they've become a bit more sensible and
pick mainly what they want to eat and
ask for more if they're still hungry
anything left over get eaten later
and generally they want actually far
less sugar than they used to
and they want to eat more wholesome food
more meat and actually sometimes they
want to eat vegetables
they haven't gone full carnivore like me
but that's fine because they're eating
what they want to
and I believe that's probably what's
best for them
I believe they're listening to their
body and their bodies are telling them
go any vegetables and that's fine with
me
so intuitive eating is difficult but not
impossible
it takes some effort and definitely
takes some getting used to it but we can
all do it

## Conclusion

Intermittent fasting can be
incredibly potent, and potentially has
multiple health benefits. It's proven to
be beneficial in fat loss and diabetes
and anecdotally helpful in many other
conditions. It's easy to do,
requires no special training,
no supplements or pills,
and can be done by almost anyone. If you're pregnant breastfeeding or a
child it's not routinely recommended so,
if you do fall into these categories
then you should speak to your doctor
about the risks and benefits of
intermittent fasting.
