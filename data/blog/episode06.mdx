# Intermittent Fasting (simple tips) - Episode 06

## Intro

Welcome to the Meat Medic Podcast. I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## What is it?

Intermittent fasting, otherwise known as
time restricted eating, has been around
for decades. In fact fasting as a
therapeutic intervention has gone back
thousands of years to the days of
Hippocrates around 450 BC.

He used to recommend therapeutic fasting
for all sorts of diseases and illnesses,
prescribing water-only diets or possibly
medicinal teas or predominantly liquid
diets for others. Even back then the
benefits of fasting were seemingly well
known.

Now fast forward 2000 or so years are
and intermittent fasting is very popular.

Is it helpful though
or is it just a fad?

Is it required
or is it harmful?

Well let's discuss.

Intermittent fasting has been around
for thousands of years as we said but
it's been probably only studied really
over the last 100 or so years,
however even then it's only recently
really been popularized in around 2012
by Dr Michael Mosley with the 5-2 diet. Now most people have probably heard of
Dr Mosley or the 5-2 diet. Interestingly outside of the medical
world fasting is performed by many
cultures and religions around the world
such as Ramadan and lent
for example.

Intermittent fasting has been shown in
literature to be beneficial in weight
loss and other medical conditions such
as type 2 diabetes,
but anecdotally many people report it
can be helpful in numerous other health
conditions and ailments, even anecdotally
as a cure for
cancer.

## How does it help?

Well we don't know exactly how it helps
but we do know that some of the
mechanisms of action

Now I briefly discussed the fasted state
in a previous episode and if you wanted
to watch that about fasting on the
carnivore diet please go back and watch
[episode 4](/blog/episode04)

So there's really two main ways I think
in which it could help -
fasting can reduce glucose, insulin and
other hormone levels within the body
and the second thing is called autophagy.

## Autophagy

I'll come back to the hormones but
first let's discuss autophagy.

Autophagy is the body's process of
reusing old and recycling old, damaged parts of cells,
or the cells entirely. Cells are required as really the basic
building blocks of all components of the
human body,
and over time they can become damaged or
broken,
much like broken stuff in our households. If we don't do anything about it,these bits of cells or entire cells
can become junk that just kind of clogs
up the cells or the rest of the
body.

If we don't want them causing issues
then it's sensible to either clean them
out, repair them, or recycle them,
and that's what autophagy is.

These cells can be either repaired or
recycled. Autophagy is kind of like quality
control for your body. If the cells aren't working correctly
then we need to do something about that
and we need to repair them or replace
them.

Why does this matter though?
Well just like in our houses we don't
want junk or or litter building up -
it'll get in the way of normal processes. You know it's hard to move around your
kitchen when it's just full of rubbish. It might stop things working correctly
or just start to cause damage to other
things around it. So just think about something in your
fridge going mouldy because it wasn't thrown
out. Eventually it can start to spread to
other food.

Another way to think about autophagy
is like cleaning up lines of computer
code - if you're a bit of a geek like me -
you don't really want all that extra
stuff in there that could cause an issue
or slow the computer down, or a web page
down for example or just even worse make
the whole system crash.

So autophagy is important for repairing
and recycling these damaged cells but
also potentially for longevity - that is
living longer and healthier. It's not known exactly how fasting
induces autophagy or at what point it
really starts,
but it's likely due to stress on the
body which fasting can induce. We don't know exactly how long you need
to fast forward to induce autophagy as
studies on this do vary,
but it's estimated to be at least around
16 hours of fasting,
which is why I believe 16:8 is a popular
type of protocol.

Now there's other ways to induce
autophagy like a low carb high fat diet,
exercise and calorie restriction. So autophagy is helpful and as far as we
know it has no real downsides.

## Hormones

Intermittent fasting can affect our
hormones in primarily a positive way, but also potentially negatively. The main hormonal effect is on insulin. Insulin is our main storage hormone
and will primarily store fat, but it will store muscle if giving the incentives. We generally don't want high insulin
levels as this can cause a myriad of other issues which we'll cover in another episode,
but high levels of insulin also cause
high levels of insulin resistance, which
is a leading cause of heart disease,
weight gain, type 2 diabetes,
hypertension and much more.

It's really one of the primary
problems if not the primary problem with
metabolic syndrome and conditions such
as polycystic ovarian syndrome. The longer you can fast for the
lower the insulin levels will fall,
and then the lower the insulin
resistance will go.

This effect is somewhat logarithmic - that
is the longer you fast for the bigger
the effect is, so it's exponential.

## How long can you fast for?

Well believe it or not the longest fast
on record
is **382 days**. That's right,
382 days. This was a Scottish man called Angus
Barbieri. He lost 276 pounds in that time. Not
surprising as he didn't eat for 382 days. He was under medical supervision the
whole time and was consuming vitamins
and other supplements to help him,
but he wasn't actually in hospital the
whole time on a bed hooked up the drips
and so forth, no he actually was at home. He just went into the hospital I think
every few days for some tests and monitoring.

Now I'm not recommending you do a 382 day
fast, and if you do well look I think you
probably need some serious medical
oversigh,
but you know usually 16 to 24 hours is
very safe with vew few problems.

So common fasting regimens are 16:8 - most
people have heard of that. That's fasting
for 16 hours and eating for eight,
or maybe 18:6 or 5:2 - that's eating for five days and
typically fasting for two days, either
complete fast or maybe just a 16:8 on two
days.

Some do what we call OMAD or _one meal a
day_, others do alternate day fasting (ADF). So there's many benefits to intermittent
fasting particularly for metabolic
health and I recommend it to a lot of my
patients,
but there are also some dangers that you
should be aware of.

Now whilst very rare it can cause
electrolyte disturbances
and there are risks of gallstones and
kidney stones forming. It can also trigger gout attacks,
thankfully though these are rare and
mostly in high risk patients
who didn't drink enough water or
electrolytes or fasted for far too long. Patients with type 2 diabetes can fast
and even patients with type 1 diabetes
can fast but really they should be
medically supervised.

Intermittent fasting is not that dangerous
as long as you're keeping an eye on
your glucose levels, but prolonged
fasting is much more dangerous for type
1 diabetes.

**However some diabetes medications
can be dangerous** with fasting
so you should speak to your health
professional before you engage in
fasting if you have health concerns.

This topic actually came up on one of my
doctor Facebook groups the
low-carb down under group,
and it was actually today
someone was asking about the medications
called SGLT2 Inhibitors with type 2
diabetes and a lot of people reporting
following low carb diets or
intermittent fasting - they've had
serious issues when they've been on
these medications. That doesn't mean you can't fast if
you're on these medications but it means that you probably have
to stop them before doing fasting - so
speak to your doctor about that.

If your doctor doesn't really know
that much about fasting then you can
find one like me or other people of
course that does to get advice from.

## How to do fasting?

So you've decided that you want to try
fasting. Well great fantastic but how do
you actually start?

Thankfully it's actually pretty
easy. Once you've got the go ahead from your
doctor or you're very confident yourself
in starting then you kind of just get
started. Usually you continue your overnight fast
into the next day. When you're sleeping
you wouldn't normally be eating,
so it kind of makes sense to extend this
rather than trying to fit in a whole fast
somewhere else in the day.

As we said earlier the longer you
can fast for the better it is. It's
exponential,
and a 16 hour fast is actually better
than two lots of eight hour fasts. In reality this usually means
skipping breakfast and then eating lunch.

It's a little more than that though
one of the biggest mistakes I see people
making with intermittent fasting is that
they think it's just not eating. Now that's actually not fasting it's
simply just not eating.

Fasting means not having anything which
will break a fast. Unfortunately I can't give you a definitive list
of things that will or won't break fast,
but for the most part
anything other than water could
potentially break a fast. Black tea, black coffee, herbal
tea, green tea: these are unlikely to
realistically break a fast,
but if you add anything with any real
substance like cream milk even possibly
butter
then it will probably break your fast.

Now what happens then is you're not
fasting,
you're just simply not eating and that's
when you can get issues. This comes back to what I mentioned
in a previous episode about the fasting
state, or the fasted state rather. When your body is in the fasted state
most people don't get very hungry
because the body can actually see its
own fat stores and use its own fat
stores. The hormone **leptin** gets unblocked. However if your insulin goes up leptin
becomes blocked, your body can't see the
fat stores, has very little energy itself
because you've used some of your muscle
glycogen and so forth overnight,
so it will kind of literally think that
you're dying because your brain is
telling you that you're basically dying
because you've got no fuel stores and as far
as it knows you've got no no muscle
glycogen and no liver glycogen left. You've also told your brain you have no fat stores as far as your body's
telling it,
and so you just become extremely hungry,
and extremely you know angry , and **HANGRY**
basically

## Won't I get hungry?

This is a question I often get asked:
"won't I feel hungry doing
intermittent fasting?" Well actually no
surprisingly not because as I said
that's your hormones doing what they're
meant to,
particularly these two hormones insulin
and leptin. As I said leptin is a hormone that
essentially tells your brain
'it's okay I have enough fat already
you don't need to keep eating'.

> Think of it like your fuel gauge in your
> car,
> and your fat stores are your fuel tank insulin blocks this hormone
> so if you reduce your insulin your body
> can actually see your fat stores and not
> panic because you're not eating.

So another question I often get asked is
won't I just overeat when I do eat? Well again really the answer is no, not usually,
because your insulin levels will be
lower and your leptin won't be as
blocked. So you most likely are not going to want to
overeat because your body can actually
see that you've got plenty of energy
already. Of course you can force it and you
can just overeat on purpose but
obviously that's a little bit silly.

Think back.
I'm sure there's been a time when you
forgot to eat breakfast. What happened?

- you didn't just die
- you didn't just go out and eat
  everything inside
- you probably weren't even that hungry
- you probably just got to the end of the
  work day and thought Oh I haven't even
  eaten today
  and then likely when you get home you
  probably just ate a normal meal

Think again about a time where you've
maybe had a super quick breakfast on the go, you've had
like a really tiny you know piece of
quick toast or or you know coffee. By lunchtime you're probably starving,
and just absolutely famished and you're
probably just gorge yourself on food. Just try it if you're not sure. Try it - go one day
just do black coffee in the morning or
nothing and wait till lunch see how
hungry you are. The next day have coffee with milk or
sugar in it,
and see the difference in how hungry you
are on that one.

Now some people can struggle a little
depending on their own metabolic health, so some degree of willpower may be
required to push through at least in the
early stages,
but it improves pretty quickly.

## How to break the fast?

Let's assume that you've done the fast
and we're coming up now on let's say 16
hours or whatever other time you wanted
to fast for. The question then is how do we break the
fast?

I mentioned in a previous episode
the breakfast is not the most important
meal of the day. I mean after all,
I'm talking about skipping breakfast. So breakfast isn't the most important
meal of the day but _break fast_
is the most important meal of the day.

When you're doing a 16 hour fast it
doesn't really make that much difference.
I'll cover this in the next episode on
prolonged therapeutic fasting but with a
16 hour fast even 18 or 24 it doesn't
really make that much difference what
you do for breaking the fast. Generally
I'd probably suggest you do a smallish
meal, with relatively low to no carbohydrate
content and then increase it later again
if you're still hungry. The reason we do this is to not spike
our insulin levels very high. This is to try and prevent the condition called
re-feeding syndrome.

Doing intermittent fasting for 16 hours -
refeeding syndrome is incredibly
unlikely to happen
but we'll cover this in another episode. You do need to be aware of refeeding syndrome but it's really only if
you're doing prolonged therapeutic
fasting.

If you're interested though do some
research into this a lot but I will
cover it in the next episode.

## Who shouldn't do intermittent fasting?

So fasting can be incredibly powerful
but should everybody be doing fasting? Unfortunately like many things we don't
have the data to say categorically that
it's healthy for everybody. There are some people who are not
advised to do intermittent fasting, even
though it's almost certainly going to be
safe for them because I'm sure they've
skipped breakfast at some point,
we just don't have the data to support
the use of it in all people.

### Pregnancy

So it's not recommended to do
intermittent fasting if you're pregnant
or breastfeeding due to the increased
metabolic demands on the body. The likelihood is it's not going to
cause problems if you do skip a few
meals here and there I'm sure you've
done it before,
as long as you listen to your body and
if you're feeling faint or unwell then
you should eat. Now it's not officially recommended, I
have to tell you that,
but I'm sure there's pregnant women all
over the world that have skipped a meal
here and there by accident probably
and they didn't just have any massive
problems. In fact intermittent fasting could
potentially reduce the risk of
gestational diabetes significantly and
the possibility of other
pregnancy-related issues,
although there's no studies to my
knowledge that have looked at that
specifically. Unfortunately it's pretty impossible to
get ethical permission, understandably
of course, to test things on pregnant
women, so the problem there is the data
is always very very lacking. There's some Obstetricians and
fertility specialists that do recommend
this way of eating intermittent fasting
to patients, indeed I was listening to a podcast
recently with Dr Anthony Chaffee the
plant free MD and Dr Robert Kiltz. Dr
Kiltz is a fertility specialist I
believe in the US and he was stating
that he often recommends intermittent
fasting for his patients, or intermittent
feasting as he calls it. He stated he found it to be
beneficial for nausea in pregnancy, particularly early on
and his his theory anyway is that
patients following a carnivore diet in
pregnancy if they find that they maybe
have like a meat aversion which we know
can happen,
that actually this could potentially be
fixed by a short period of fasting and
actually eating less.

### Children

Now it's also not routinely recommended
that children do intermittent fasting
for similar reasons again
but again if they're just listening to
their body and not eating when they're
not hungry eating if they get hungry
they really shouldn't have any downsides. After all I mean we fast when we sleep,
so you're just extending that a little
bit.

Of course I hope this goes without
saying but I'll say it anyway to be very
clear. ** Babies should not be doing intermittent
fasting**.

As I mentioned earlier fasting can
sometimes increase the risk of things
like gallstones or kidney stones
so if these are concerns you have then
you should speak to your doctor to get
health advice.

### cancer

People with cancer
can do fasting,
and there is potential for it to help. Now I can't say it will definitely work for you if you have cancer, and I'm not saying it's a cure
for cancer,
and you should definitely not stop
conventional therapy as advised by your
oncologist or hematologist,
but I would encourage all patients with
cancer to speak to their oncologist
about intermittent fasting, and particularly what we call the _metabolic
mitochondrial theory of cancer_. I'll discuss this in a future
episode.

Basically the metabolic
mitochondrial theory of cancer
really says that cancer is not just a
genetic condition it's actually really a
metabolic condition and that the vast
majority of cancer cells really can only
utilize glucose as a fuel source and if
you starve them of glucose by doing
things like intermittent fasting and
being in the so-called fasted state,
nutritional ketosis that theoretically
this is a perfect chemotherapy because
all the cancer cells will die and all
the healthy cells in your body will live.

Now as I said that's the theory it's not
proven,
and I can't say it's a cure for cancer of course, but it could help.

## Do I need to do intermittent fasting?

So I guess the question is do you need
to do intermittent fasting?

Well actually no you don't really. There's no real studies comparing
intermittent fasting to other types of
diet or lifestyle such as the
Mediterranean diet or the DASH diet or
the ornish diet, but there is data for fasting mimicking
diets. This is a diet that puts you in a
so-called fasted state. The FMD or fasting mimicking diet
does actually show comparable results to
the Mediterranean Dash and ornish diet
for many health concerns.

So what is fmd or fasting mimicking
diet? well it's a diet where you eat foods
really designed to maintain nutritional
ketosis, the fasted state, which is
basically a ketogenic diet. So if you're doing a keto diet
or a carnivore diet
you'd likely don't actually need to do
intermittent fasting on top.

Carniore diet really is by definition
a ketogenic diet, so if you're following
carnivore you'd probably don't need to
do intermittent fasting, at least, not force it, which is what I covered in a previous
episode.

Some people however do claim that you do
see further benefits, but most people who are doing a carnivore diet
naturally fast. Most eat one
or two meals a day anyway so I mean
really they're doing naturally fasting without even realizing it.

I know I personally saw some small
benefit from introducing fasting back
into my diet and I did see benefit from
when I was doing keto and intermittent
fasting on top rather than just plain keto,
but now I follow intuitive eating and I
eat when I'm hungry, fast when I'm not. Some days it's two meals others it's
three and this works well for me
sometimes it can be four or five meals, or even one.

Usually it's two meals a day, or 2MAD.

## How long can you do intermittent fasting for?

And how long can you fast at any one time? We discussed this previously, but as far as how
long you can intermittent fasting for? Well really the answer is as long as you
like. There's no upper limit on how many times
you can do intermittent fasting or how
long in total you can go for. Some do it for a few weeks and then stop
others will do it daily for months,
sometimes years. For some
it's just a way of life and it suits
them. Many do it intuitively
and don't even know that they're doing
it. There's no known harms of long-term
intermittent fasting and in fact many
studies show multiple benefits.

## Fasting for weight loss

The last thing I want to talk about is weight
loss and intermittent fasting. You can't really talk about intermittent
fasting and not discuss weight loss. Many people will use intermittent
fasting to try to lose weight, but does it work?

Well yes actually studies show it
definitely does work. There's multiple
high-powered studies that demonstrate
the people who do intermittent fasting
lose more weight,
they lose it quicker,
and they lose it for longer than
controls, whilst following the same daily
diet otherwise. Now what does that mean in plain English?

Well it basically means if you compress
the same three meals a day into say two
meals,
you'll probably lose fat and be
healthier. It's actually independent of the
calories or the content of the food and
this has been corroborated by many many
studies. You can obviously add a calorie
reduction in as well and this could help
you to lose more weight, but weight loss isn't really about the
calories for most people, more so what your body does with those
calories.

I'm going to be covering weight loss
extensively in another episode but
briefly when this is controlled by
hormones like cortisol and insulin and
both of these are essentially storage
hormones, that is they put your body into
a kind of storage mode, if your body is in storage mode it
doesn't really matter how many calories
you eat you'll likely struggle to lose
weight because the body doesn't want to
lose weight. If you aren't in storage mode
you will probably lose weight naturally.

Intermittent fasting reduces both
cortisol and insulin and this can help
you flip that switch out of storage mode,
which is really how it helps, not the
calorie reduction. As we said earlier even eating the
same diet, those people who compressed it
into one or two meals a day versus three
normal meals lost more weight, lost it
quicker, and lost it for longer when they
returned to their previous diets.

## More Hormones

Now this is actually a good time to talk
about hormones. We mentioned leptin earlier and of
course cortisol and insulin just now. Studies in fasting has proven to
affect testosterone levels in men,
are very likely to affect estrogen and
progesterone levels in females,
mostly through a pre-hormone called kiss-peptin.

With regards to testosterone most men
find that initially testosterone levels
can reduce slightly, but then in the longer term, usually a
few months, levels can actually increase back above
where their baseline was,
and actually produce higher testosterone
as a result.

Now interestingly the initial drop
doesn't appear to actually be clinically
significant,
but the rise afterwards actually is
which is absolutely fascinating. Testosterone levels going up is
actually a good thing.

I'm going to cover this in a future
episode, but testosterone has multiple health
benefits for men and for women and we
don't need to fear testosterone.

In females we are much more
concerned with estrogen and progesterone
and these can be affected by
intermittent fasting. Some women appear to be affected more
than others and whilst in men generally
the effect is favorable,
some women do find the intermittent
fasting can adversely affect their cycle
and hormone imbalance can occur which
can have negative effects. This is a very personal thing and
unfortunately cannot be tested for prior
to starting intermittent fasting,
so you can't know if it will adversely
affect you until you try it. Thankfully though most women don't have
any issues with intermittent fasting and
if you do it's not permanent and will
quickly resolve when you stop fasting.

There's also some evidence, anecdotal yes
but there's some evidence that women who
are affected by fasting will do better
with longer but less frequent fasts
rather than shorter but more frequent
fasts.

## Conclusion

Intermittent fasting can be
incredibly potent, and potentially has
multiple health benefits. It's proven to
be beneficial in fat loss and diabetes
and anecdotally helpful in many other
conditions. It's easy to do,
requires no special training,
no supplements or pills,
and can be done by almost anyone. If you're pregnant breastfeeding or a
child it's not routinely recommended so,
if you do fall into these categories
then you should speak to your doctor
about the risks and benefits of
intermittent fasting.
