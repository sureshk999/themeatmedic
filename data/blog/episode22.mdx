summary: "There's so much division in the carnivore community, so much disagreement on what the carnivore diet is, what we should be eating to maintain a healthy life, and how we can get the optimum nutrition, but it doesn't have to be this way. We can learn from each other if we stop fighting and listen to others, listen to their experiences and experiments and then learn how to apply it to our own health."
