summary: "In today's episode I discuss ... well this. Getting advice from random strangers on the internet. Like many people I'm on social media, of course, I'm on YouTube, but also Reddit, Facebook, Instagram etc. And I stumbled across so many threads where people are encouraging each other to eat utter garbage, processed foods, and just blatantly dangerous food, telling each other it's good for them.

Please just stop getting advice from people who haven't got a clue!"
