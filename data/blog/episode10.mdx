summary: "I've been carnivore for 4 months now. I wanted to share my latest blood test results, and I wanted to discuss the lie that we've all been sold - that a 'balanced' diet, aka 'everything in moderation' is perfectly healthy for us. It isn't!

These food companies and governments know we can't moderate. They know their food is hyper addictive. And they must know the food is bad for us. Yet they push it anyway."
