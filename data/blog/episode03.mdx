# Transcript

## Intro

Welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## Background

I've spoken previous a little bit about my
personal health journey and how I came
to this point and in today's episode I want
to be discussing more about the
carnivore diet and the benefits it's
given me.

So I've been kind on it now for around
three months, but what does carnivore actually mean?
Well it seems carnivore can mean
almost anything and well the
interpretations of the diet can get a
little bit loose.

## The origins of the carnivore diet?

I'm pretty sure it's Dr Sean Baker who
originally named the carnivore diet and
if you haven't checked out his podcast
Revero - please do.

I'm a big fan of his and I think he's
doing amazing things with Revero.

I listened to a number of his episodes
today in the car and I just I find the
success stories just so incredibly
powerful and inspiring and I actually
tell all my patients to go and listen to
them.

The carnivore diet is trending right now.
A lot of people are talking about it,
especially as it's World carnivore month.
I actually get a lot of patients coming
in to talk to me about it now even
though they don't know that I'm
doing it. In fact I had maybe six new
patients the other day just in one
day and wanting to do the carnivore diet.

I do get a few patients referred to me
from the Aussie carnivores group so
shout out to them they're a great bunch
of supportive carnivores for the Australia
crowd, but these people that came to see me
they'd never even heard of me they were
just random people in the public,
wanting to do carnivore, which I think is
amazing.

The history of this kind of way of
eating as we call it goes back hundreds
or maybe thousands of years. Now many of
course will say that we've been eating a
carnivore diet for millions of years and
I agree with that.

Medically though I think it came to
prominence with Dr James H Salisbury - I
think around 1850-1865. The inventor of the Salisbury steak - he was helping to cure people of
diseases primarily through a red red
meat and water diet.

Like other people who advocate for this
carnivore diet Salisbury believed that
plants could be harmful. So the Salisbury steak was ground beef
but really it was actually more than
that: it was a particular way of grinding
the beef so that it had next to no
gristle (the so-called meat fiber). This was very important to the healing
and he thought it would completely allow
the gut to rest and heal,
and by all reports I think he got pretty
good success with patients.

So we've been doing it for hundreds of
years in medicine - in literature and
probably thousands outside of that
but now we're talking about it on social
media.

Influencers are suggesting it so a lot
of people are talking about it, yet there's a lot of argument and
disagreement about what the diet
actually should be.

Some refer to the carnivore diet as only
meat, and others say it must include
organ meats. Others say no you have to eat only
ruminant animals, and others say you can eat
non-ruminants. Some say white meat is fine, others
say no it has to be red meat. Some say
you can drink milk or have yogurt and
cheese others say no you can't.
There's even some people out there who
say you need to eat fruit like Dr Paul
saladino the carnivore MD. Now he's saying at the moment that you
should eat fruit and honey and that
actually you _must_ eat fruit and honey -
that it's essential for life.

Now I'm going to do another episode on
that, but if you want to please go ahead and
listen to his carnivore MD podcast. I
think he puts out some good stuff,
I just disagree with him on this point

## What do I eat?

In my case I've actually slightly
evolved over the last three months in
what I've been eating, but I've really
mainly been eating beef eggs butter and
seasoning only with salt and drinking
water. A bit of bacon as well. I've been doing what they call
BBBE - beef butter bacon eggs.

At the start I was eating quite a bit
of bacon but I've actually reduced that
down and I still have the occasional bit
though and I throw in some pork belly
which is bacon basically. Fish, seafood
and some lean meats as well like chicken
but they're pretty few and far between.

I just don't feel that good on them. I don't know why. I guess I'll explore that in time.

I eat cheese but I find it quite moorish
and it's very easy for me to over
indulge, so I'm very very careful with it. I think a lot of people who struggle
with beig on the carnivore diet especially
with weight may just be over indulging
on meat on cheese and dairy so
just keep a little eye on that one.

I really focus on red meat - as I said, I just
don't feel that great on others but even lamb though for
some reason it just doesn't taste that
good to me anymore. I'm not sure why
because I used to love it, I just really
prefer the taste of beef now.

I used to eat a lot of kangaroo, especially as it's
quite cheap here in Australia but again
I've just gone off the taste of it and I
just I just think I'm really sensitive
to the fat content of food now,
which is really interesting and even if
I have lesser kind of fatty meat but
then add lots of butter I still don't
feel as good as just eating the fat from
beef which is which I think I just find
really fascinating.

I actually had some rump steak the
other night and it just, I don't know, it
just didn't really taste that good.

I didn't cook it badly. I cooked
it well (rare, not well-done), just how I like it. The meat wasn't
off or anything like that I think I just
needed more fat even though I ate it
with with butter.

Now compare this to the T-bone I had the
night before oh man that was Juicy and
Delicious but full of fat and it just
filled me up completely.

So I still eat white meat it just doesn't fill me up that
much. I just don't find myself as
energetic as I do when I eat fatty meats particularly beef.

I've also got off the taste of a lot of
the less fatty meats as I said and I
know some people are going to watch this, listen to this and read this and say "oh yeah but that's
because he's not using any herbs or
spices and yeah the food's going to be
boring"

Maybe that's true, but that's kind of the point of
what I'm doing in this pure carnivore - is
to not consume plants to not add herbs
and seasonings.

So you know I figure there's no point
forcing myself to eat food that I don't
like that's kind of really the opposite
of what we're trying to achieve with the
carnivore diet. We want to make it sustainable in the
long term and eating food that you don't
want to, that you don't like is just not
sustainable.

## How much am I eating?

Well it varies a lot on a day-to-day
basis. I eat intuitively - so what that means is I
eat what I want when I want.

That sounds amazing but I'm not just
eating crap all the time now - I'm eating
very clean, very pure carnivore. Some days I can eat maybe, I don't know
up to two kilograms of beef plus maybe
four to six eggs other days a single steak
with a little bit of butter maybe.

I listen to my body.

I don't count calories so I've not
really got any idea what my caloric
intake actually is but if I had to guess
I'd probably say maybe on average 2500-3000 calories a day.

Sometimes I can eat 4000. and that's
more than I've ever eaten before even
when I was 20 I'd been going to the gym
every single day for an hour or two yet
I'm losing fat and gaining muscle.

Even in my 20s even go to the gym daily
I couldn't build much muscle,
but now I am without even really trying
I've still got a way to go don't get me
wrong but I'm seeing great success with
the carnivore diet.

Anyway I was eating three to four times
a day near the start of my carnivore
journey I just I just couldn't seem to
get enough food.

Some people do find this near the start -
they just seem to just need to
eat a lot - they're just hungry all the
time. Other people just don't feel hungry
at all which is I find really
interesting.

I've since reduced it down and I just
felt I didn't really need as much and
I'm listening a lot more to my body now. I
think at the start maybe I was being a
bit greedy as well, I don't know.

I've also doing started doing a little
bit more fasting but I think
probably more just intuitive eating. I'm
not forcing myself to fast like you would on a true intermittent fasting regimen.

I do feel a bit better doing a bit more
fasting but it's not a huge difference.

We know the benefits that
intermittent fasting can have but it's
not really been studied on a carnivore
diet. Some people like Dr Anthony Chaffee the
plant free MD say that you don't need to
fast, but often they are fasting anyway -
just not forced fasting. That is they're
not withholding food from themselves
they're just not eating if they're not
hungry, and that's what I'm doing and that's
intuitive eating.

So for the last week I've actually been
treating myself as a three-month treat
on carnivore eating high quality steaks
for dinner - rib eyes, scotch fillets
Porterhouses and T-Bones these are all nice
juicy fatty cuts.

I've been feeling good on one meal a day on
these interestingly though when I said I
had the rump I actually needed to eat a
lot more I needed to eat three meals
after that just to get feel full, to feel
kind of happy that I've ate enough food.

I just think that's really interesting I
ended up eating far more calories when I
didn't eat the fat.

So my eating day is something like:

- breakfast I'll probably skip
- lunch I'll usually skip but if I'm hungry I'll eat
  maybe 500 grams of beef probably a roast, either from the deli counter - sliced roast - or something I've cooked on
  the weekend and sliced up and taken into work
- dinners usually maybe like 6 p.m usually, like a steak or maybe a chuck roast, usually around half to maybe one kilogram of beef

I was eating quite a lot of chuck in
my early days, still do but I've kind of since gone off
it a little bit actually I had some
tonight and it was actually really nice.

I don't know why I went off the taste.
I kind of feel like maybe the rib eyes
had actually ruined my taste for Chuck
but maybe it was something else because
I did have it tonight and I actually
found it quite tasty,
which is good because it's cheap here -
it's about a third of the price of rib
eyes.

So I vary between probably half a
kilogram and two kilograms of meat a day. It really is quite variable.

So when people like my patients ask me, "how much should they eat?" or "how
much do I eat?"

I kind of have to tell them that I genuinely don't know how much
I eat and it's hard to advise how much
they should eat. I tell them to eat when they're hungry. Some days they might have three to four
meals like me other days they might just
have one.

> I just advise them to eat to satiety and stop when it stops tasting good.

I believe that's the signal that your body has had enough of whatever it is that you're eating.

Now I'm not a big guy I'm around 70 kgs, so
you would think that maybe up to two
kilograms of beef a day sounds just a
ridiculous amount for me but as I said
I'm losing fat and gaining muscle. I'm pretty active but not Super
Active - I mean I'm really just working
out like 15-20 minutes a day, it's not a
great deal.

I think this just goes to show that the
body doesn't really work on calories the
and certainly the fat isn't about
calories or eating fat,
it's what your body does with those
calories,
and I'll be covering this in another
episode in the future.

## What herbs did to me

So we've spoke about what I am eating,
but what about what I'm not eating?

My experience with herbs and steakettes -
well basically I've completely stripped
out plants - all plants.

I haven't consumed a single plant in
three months.

Actually that's not entirely true I have
had a couple of times where I've tested
to see what the effect would be like -
really tiny bits of plants,
and it didn't actually really go very
well at all.

The first time I had some steakettes from
our usual butcher -
steakheads are kind of like
um like square flat burger patties -
actually I should really ask the butcher
to find out what was actually in them,
but they had some sort of herbs in them,
probably some breadcrumbs to bind them
as well I'm not sure.

I opened the pack up, saw the green and I was like

> green is not a carnivore color

Let's
just try them and see what happens. Okay
fair enough they weren't mouldy it was
just it was just herbs.

**So I kind of wish I hadn't.** Really within about five minutes I just felt
totally exhausted. I could barely stay
awake. I started to just feel weird and
wrong. Really hard to explain,
but I went from feeling kind of just out
of this world on Carnivore to just to
just barely awake. Actually I did go to sleep on the sofa
and I wasn't even tired five minutes
before, I just couldn't
_not_ sleep.

I couldn't fight it.

I woke up I think three four hours later
just achy and sore all over my body,
not just because I fell asleep on the
sofa in an awkward position - I mean I'd
done that plenty of times before and
felt okay, nothing really hurt, but this
time _everything_ just hurt. My hands, my
feet, my fingers, my toes. Like every part
of me just hurt.

I felt really sluggish and lethargic. No
energy I couldn't even get myself up off
the sofa
but my mental health was also just just
crushed.

I'd gone from feeling like I
said out of this world mentally to just
not even wanting to be alive. Not
suicidal but just really not wanting to
live.

I've gone from wanting to work out twice
a day, to wanting to just open the garage and
just throw my weights out and close it
again.

Honestly if I'd had the energy I
probably would have.

It was really scary. A few hours later though it started to
pass and I could actually feel myself
just kind of physically and mentally
improving,
like just going up those levels. A really bizarre feeling.

Fast forward a few hours and it was pretty much
back to normal. I got up off the sofa started working out
again.

So again I've gone from loving my weights, to hating my weights to
loving my weights again.

Really odd. The workout pretty much
sucked but I was able to do it
and mentally I felt amazing again.

Really really bizarre experience. Maybe
it was coincidence? Maybe, it's possible
but I've had similar episodes since with
things like burgers
and sausages.

I had a really bad
experience when I had some chicken with
some sort of soy sauce on it.

So I actually stopped experimenting with food.

Some people can go back to these things
maybe maybe one day I will but for now
I'm gonna stay pure carnivore.

No plants no herbs no spices no
preservatives no seed oils and _no coffee._

## Addictions

Now that one was actually surprisingly
easy.

I was quite scared about getting off
coffee because I'd done it before and I
got pretty bad withdrawal symptoms,
but surprisingly it was actually really
easy on carnivore. I don't know why,
but I've seen a few people posting
similar stories about going off coffee
when they've been doing carnivore that
they've really struggled before but now
it's easier.

I've even had some patients tell me on
Carnivore that they've actually found less
addictive behaviors so things like
smoking and drinking that they're just less inclined to do
them, and it seems easier to cut down,
which is absolutely fascinating.

## Other benefits of the carnivore diet

So how has the carnivore diet really
helped me?

Well I mean in just so many ways it's
hard to really list them all.

I guess the
most obvious is I've lost a lot of fat.

Now I started around 35% body fat,
probably slightly more. I
didn't actually measure myself
beforehand which was a bit silly but
then I wasn't really planning on
actually doing carnivore I just kind of
did it after I went to low carb down
under and listened to Dr Chaffee speak.

I've had a dexa scan not that long ago
before I started which showed around 35
body fat so I'm going to use that as a
guide. I've dropped to around maybe I think
probably 25%. My [body calipers](https://amzn.to/3BrFlwO) say between 20
and 25 I think it's probably 25.

I'll get a repeat dexa scan at some
point but they're not always super super
accurate and they can be fooled.

I've not just lost a lot of fat though,
I've actually gained a lot of muscle.

Loads of people want to lose weight, but
that's really just a number on the scale. What we really want to lose is fat.

Now in the carnivore groups you know you
see people amazing success stories
losing hundreds of pounds, maybe 200+ and I saw
one that said they lost something like
150 kilos. It's hard to even comprehend that amount of weight loss.

Personally my weight's
actually gone up but I'm totally cool
with this because I know I've lost fat
and gained muscle.

I'm pretty sure I've lost around seven
kilograms of fat at least and gained
maybe 10 kilograms of muscle. I might be slightly out but I think
it's pretty accurate.

I may not look enormously muscly but
I wasn't starting from a lot
so the difference is actually pretty big.

At some point I'll post some pictures on
my Instagram so people that follow me
can see the changes but I'm not quite
ready for that yet. Being a doctor here in Australia we have
to be pretty careful about what
we post on social media
and posting kind of half nude photos of
myself may attract some unwanted attention so I
want to make sure that I'm actually
posting something that's worthwhile that
shows the changes.

So I've lost a lot of weight but I think
really the best thing is actually the energy. There's just like insane energy levels and
they're just through the roof.

I went from feeling flat tired and
definitely old to feeling youthful and
vibrant.

> I really do feel like a teenager
> again.

My zest for life just amazing.
I just kind of want to live now and
experience life, nature, and just be part of
the planet that we live on.

These are similar stories that a lot of
other carnivores say and I was listening
to the Revero
podcast with Dr Baker earlier and he was
interviewing someone and they said just
exactly the same thing and they were
saying they almost didn't want to say it
out loud because it just sounded so
ridiculous but that's how they felt, and
I feel exactly the same.

I definitely never felt this good when I
was doing keto or intermittent fasting.

I just want to research and read
and learn- I've actually got some
[books](/shop) to go through - they are on order Dr Ken
Barry's book The Lies my doctor told me and
Dr Sean Baker's book the carnivore diet.
I can't wait for them to arrive and
actually start to read them.

There's a couple others I want to read
as well like The Carnivore Code by Dr Paul
saladino and the Carnivore Cure by
nutrition with Judy (Judy Cho).

It's great to think my energy isn't
really coming from coffee anymore.

As I said I'm not drinking any caffeine
at all, no pills, no tea, no coffee, no
sodas.

> It's kind of crazy and sad to think I
> actually needed coffee to survive before

My gut issues have completely
resolved - amazing. I never had any diagnosed condition but
I guarantee I had IBS.
I used to go probably five times a day
sometimes having to rush to the toilet,
you know sometimes a bit explosive.
Now I just go
maybe once a day at most honestly takes
about five seconds and I'm done and
on with the day.

My mental health has improved dramatically.
I spoke previously about how I maybe had
some issues when I was at University but
never anything actually diagnosed, but
there's definitely been times in my life
when I was very stressed, anxious or
maybe a bit low,
but now I kind of just feel amazing all
the time.

People say this is abnormal and they
call it euphoria,
but I think it's just how we're meant to
feel, it's just most of us don't feel this way - ever.

My sleep has definitely improved
now I was lucky that I never really had
any major sleep issues but there were
definitely times where I found it hard
to go to sleep or stay asleep, but now I
just sleep like a baby.

Bizarrely I don't wake up with a dry mouth anymore.

I mouth breathe at night, I just can't
stop myself. I don't know if that's reduced but I
definitely don't really wake up with a
dry mouth anymore.

Speaking of mouth my dentist was very
happy when I went to see him about a
month or so ago.
I've been doing carnivore about maybe a
month I think and I was quite nervous
about going -
the last time I went you know he was
pretty unhappy with me - my teeth weren't
that good,
but this time he said my teeth were
absolutely amazing with just no plaque. Better yet my impacted wisdom teeth on both sides
they now have no observable inflammation. I'm pretty happy with that. I was
pretty worried about my teeth especially
when you know you see scary stories
about scurvy on the carnivore diet.

Now I know um Joey Schwartz AKA
carnivore camaraderie he did a video on
this recently claiming he had scurvy
from carnivore. Now I'm not going to comment that much
on this I think it's been covered fairly
extensively already, but I don't think it's very likely that he had scurvy.

There's next to no case reports of scurvy on the
carnivore diet. It'd be making pretty big
news I think if there was.

Another small but I think really
significant change is my dandruff has
completely gone
which is really really nice. Dandruff's
one of those conditions that
seems small but it really can affect
people's confidence and just adverseley
affect their mental health. I got to the point I was even
getting eyebrow dandruff which is
weird and unpleasant. That's completely gone
now.

I'm pretty sure the hair on top of
my head is regrowing slowly . I can't be
sure but definitely under here oh sorry
I'm pointing to underneath my chin uh
it's filling in I had a little bald spot
there which is now filling in
now.

I like to think I don't really care
about my pretty bald head but truth be
told you know I'd love to have more hair.
I'd never really get implants I don't
think but yep if it naturally grew yeah of
course I'd be very very happy.

My personal life has greatly improved
especially at home. My wife is certainly very happy with
the changes. No not what you're thinking get your
mind out of the gutter 😁 well actually no
that has improved a little bit, but what
I mean is I'm organized and active. I
want to clean. I want to tidy and organize the house, do
laundry, ironing, cooking, just generally
be productive.

I've also noticed amazing changes in my
kids I'll be covering kids in another
episode but our kids aren't really doing
full carnivore but they are eating a lot
more red meat and less sugar and a lot
more fat and I've noticed their behavior
is definitely better. They are more attentive, more
keen to learn, do arts and crafts and
just generally less TV time. They're growing like crazy as well
and my little carnivore baby as we call
her our two-year-old Freya, she wasn't a
pure carnivore but she mostly just ate
meat from very early on and she is
huge for her age, incredibly strong,
athletic and super intelligent. She's
just turned two she's basically already
toilet trained. All my kids are very intelligent of
course and I love them all dearly and
equally of course,
but there's no denying that there is a
difference between the two that weren't
really that carnivore and the one that
is.

## Future plans

So where am I going from here?
I'm definitely going to continue
carnivore for now. If I ever stop feeling
good I'll reassess,
but the way that I feel now I doubt I'll
ever stop. It's only been two to three months so
far but there's really nothing but
positives no negatives at all.

## Blood tests

My Bloods are amazing my LDL-C is up a
little bit of course
but I don't really care about that. In
fact it's actually a good thing there's
a lot of studies that show a high LDL-C
it's protective for heart disease and
all cause mortality.

My inflammation is way down.

My insulin resistance is way down.

My triglycerides are way down.

My HDL is way
up

In fact all my biomarkers for heart disease
and inflammation are just non-existent
and my LP(a) is completely
undetectable. This is a marker for
damaged LDL cholesterol.

Best of all my free testosterone has gone up by well
over 50% really about 70% in two months.

That's incredible and that's probably why I feel so good.

My kidney function is perfect and in
fact many people find their kidney
functions improve on Carnivore diet -
we don't need to fear the protein in the
kidneys it's extremely hard to damage
your kidneys with protein and really
what damages it more than anything else
is sugar.

I'm not finding it in any way difficult. There's really no gray areas like there
is on a low carb or Keto diet. I find it very easy for me. It's just
it's pretty black and white.

So I'm starting to talk to my patients
about it and I wanted to start this
podcast to spread the word.

Some of my patients especially the
vegans ask me how do I square this with
my Medical Education and Training -
after all we're told repeatedly that red
meat is bad cholesterol is bad, carbs and
plants are good.

Now truth be told I am still
struggling a little bit with this one
because it does contradict everything
that I'm taught,
but there's really no denying how I feel.

Early on in medical school I was
actually taught that medicine is not
static and we should always be learning,
we should always be questioning and
testing, sadly though this isn't really
done anymore.

I believe that information moves on and
we need to move with it. It's hard though when the whole medical
establishment is telling you that you're
wrong and so those of us that are
doing this kind of work we actually have
to be pretty careful. We have to know our
stuff, be able to cite studies and
supporting evidence and potentially
defend ourselves publicly,
so it's a bit scary to actually put
yourself out there but I think it's
worth it and I'm taking this risk.
