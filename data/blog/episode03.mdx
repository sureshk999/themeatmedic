# Transcript

## Intro

Welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr Suresh Khirwadkar.

I'm a GP a lifestyle physician and I'm a
practicing carnivore.
I've had great success myself personally
and with patients by following a
carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about the
many benefits of eating meat.

## Background

welcome to the meet medic podcast I'm
your host Dr sarash kawadka I'm a GP and
lifestyle physician and I'm a practicing
Carnival
I've had great success myself and with
patience by following a carnivore diet
and I want to spread the word about how
to achieve Optimal Health through diet
nutrition and lifestyle changes
I've spoken a little bit about my
personal health journey and how I came
to this point and today's episode I want
to be discussing more about the
carnivore diet and the benefits it's
given me
so I've been kind of off for around
three months now
what does Carnival actually mean
well it seems it carnivore can mean
almost anything and well the
who started the carnivore diet?
interpretations of the diet can get a
little bit loose
I'm pretty sure it's Dr Sean Baker who
originally named the carnivore diet and
if you haven't checked out his podcast
Rivero please do
I'm a big fan of his and I think he's
doing amazing things with Rivero I
listened to a number of his episodes
today in the car and I just I find the
success story is just so incredibly
powerful and inspiring and I actually
tell all my patients to go and listen to
them
the carnivore diet is trending right now
A lot of people are talking about it
especially as it's World Carnival month
I actually get a lot of patients coming
in to talk to me about it now even
though they don't know that even I'm
doing it in fact I had maybe six new
patients the other day uh just in one
day and wanting to do the carnival diet
I do get a few patients referred to me
from the Aussie carnivores group so
shout out to them they're a great bunch
of supportive carnivores for Australia
crowd
but these people that came to see me
they'd never even heard of me they were
just random people in the in the public
wanting to do Carnival which I think is
amazing it really is
anyway
the history of this kind of way of
eating as we call it goes back hundreds
of maybe thousands of years now many of
course will say that we've been eating a
carnivore diet for millions of years and
I agree with that
Dr James H Salisbury
medically though I think it came to
prominence with Dr James H Salisbury I
think around 1850 1865 a call
the inventor of the Salisbury steak
so he was helping to cure people of
diseases primarily through a red red
meat and water diet
like other people who advocate for this
carnivore diet Salisbury believed that
plants could be harmful
so the Salisbury steak was ground beef
but really it was actually more than
that it was a particular way of grinding
the beef so that it had next to no
gristle the so-called meat fiber
this was very important to the healing
and he thought it would completely allow
the gut to rest and heal
and by all reports I think he got pretty
good success with patients
so we've been doing it for hundreds of
years in medicine in literature and
probably thousands outside of that
but now we're talking about it on social
media
influencers are suggesting it so a lot
of people are talking about it
yeah there's a lot of argument and
disagreement about what the diet
actually should be
some refer to the carnivore diet as only
meat and others say it must include
organ Meats
others say no you have to eat only
ruminant animals others say you can eat
non-ruminants
some say white white meat is fine others
say no it has to be red meat some say
you can drink milk or have yogurt and
cheese others say no you can't
there's even some people out there who
say you need to eat fruit like Dr Paul
saladino the carnivore MD
now he's saying at the moment that you
should eat fruit and honey and that
actually you must eat fruit and honey
that is essential for life
now I'm going to do another episode on
that
but if you want to please go ahead and
listen to his carnivore MD podcast I
think he just put out some good stuff
I just disagree with him on this point
what am I eating?
in my case I've actually slightly
evolved over the last three months in
what I've been eating but I've really
mainly been eating beef eggs butter and
seasoning only with salt and drinking
water
bit of bacon as well and what they call
BBE beef butter bacon eggs
now the start I was eating quite a bit
of bacon but I've actually reduced that
down and I still have the occasional bit
though and I throw in some pork belly
which is bacon basically Fish seafood
and some lean meats as well like chicken
but they're pretty few and far between
I just don't feel that good on them
don't know why
I eat cheese but I find it quite Moorish
and it's very easy for me to over
indulge so I'm very very careful with it
now I think a lot of people who struggle
with diet the carnival diet especially
with weight may just be over indulging
on meat on cheese rather and dairy so
just keep a little eye on that one
so I really focus on red meat I just
don't feel that great on Lam though for
some reason it just doesn't taste that
good to me anymore I'm not sure why
because I used to love it I just really
prefer the taste of beef
I used to eat a lot of kangaroo it's
quite cheap here in Australia but again
I've just gone off the taste of it and I
just I just think I'm really sensitive
to the fat content of food now
which is really interesting and even if
I have lesser kind of fatty meat but
then add lots of butter I still don't
feel as good as just eating the fat from
beef which is which I think I just find
really fascinating
so I actually had some rum steak the
other night and it just I don't know it
just didn't really taste that good
I didn't cook it badly I cooked I cooked
it well how I like it the meat wasn't
off or anything like that I think I just
needed more fat even though I ate it
with with butter
now compare this to the T-bone I had the
night before oh man that was Juicy and
Delicious but full of fat and it just
filled me up completely
so I still eat white meat it just I
don't know it doesn't fill me up that
much I just don't find myself as
energetic as I do when I eat fatty Meats
particularly beef
I've also got off the taste of a lot of
that less fatty meat as I said and I
know some people are going to watch this
and say or listen to this if you're on
podcasts and say oh yeah but that's
because he's not using any herbs or
spices and yeah the food's going to be
boring
but yeah that's kind of the point of
what I'm doing in this pure Carnival is
to not consume plants to not add herbs
and Seasonings
so you know I figure there's no point
forcing myself to eat food that I don't
like that's kind of really the opposite
of what we're trying to achieve with the
carnivore diet
we want to make it sustainable in the
long term and eating food that you don't
want to that you don't like is just not
sustainable
how much am I eating?
how much am I eating
well it varies a lot on a day-to-day
basis
I.E intuitively so what that means is I
eat what I want when I want
that sounds amazing but I'm not just
eating crap all the time now I'm eating
very clean very pure carnivore
some days I can eat maybe I don't know
up to two kilograms of beef plus maybe
four to six eggs other days single steak
with a little bit of butter Maybe
I listen to my body
I don't count calories so I've not
really got any idea what my caloric
intake actually is but if I had to guess
I'd probably say maybe on average two
and a half to three thousand calories a
day
sometimes I can eat 4 000. and that's
more than I've ever eaten before even
when I was 20 I'd been going to the gym
every single day for an hour or two yet
I'm losing fat and gaining muscle
even in my 20s even go to the gym daily
I couldn't build much muscle
but now I am without even really trying
I've still got a way to go don't get me
wrong but I'm seeing great success with
the carnival diet
anyway I was eating three to four times
a day near the start of my carnivore
journey I just I just couldn't seem to
get enough food
some people do find this near the start
they just seem to really just need to
eat a lot they're just hungry all the
time other people just don't feel hungry
at all which is I find really
interesting
I've since reduced it down and I just
felt I didn't really need as much and
I'm listening a lot more to my body I
think at the start maybe I was being a
bit greedy as well I don't know
I'm also doing started doing a little
bit more fasting but I think
probably more just intuitive eating I'm
not forcing myself to fast
I do feel a bit better doing a bit more
fasting but it's not a huge difference
now we know the benefits that
intermittent fasting can have but it's
not really been studied on a carnivore
diet
some people like Dr Anthony chafee the
plant free MD say that you don't need to
fast but often they are fasting anyway
just not forced fasting that is they're
not withholding food from themselves
they're just not eating if they're not
hungry
and that's what I'm doing and that's
intuitive eating
so for the last week I've actually been
treating myself as a three-month treat
on Carnival eating high quality steaks
for dinner rib eyes Scotch fillets
Porter houses T-Bones these are all nice
juicy fatty cuts
I've been finally one meal a day on
these interestingly though when I said I
had the rump I actually needed to eat a
lot more I needed to eat three meals
after that just to get feel full to feel
kind of happy that I've ate enough food
I just think that's really interesting I
ended up eating far more calories when I
didn't eat the fat
so my eating day is something like
breakfast I'll probably skip lunch I'll
usually skip if I'm hungry I'll eat
maybe 500 grams of beef probably a roast
uh either from the deli counter roast
sliced roast or something I've cooked on
the weekend and sliced up and taked in
it took it into work
dinners usually maybe like 6 p.m usually
like a steak or maybe a chuck roast
usually around half to maybe one
kilogram of beef
that's a fat beer I know
I was eating quite a lot of chocolate in
my early days
still do but I've kind of since gone off
it a little bit actually I had some
tonight and it was actually really nice
I don't know why I went up I don't know
why I went off the taste
I kind of feel like maybe the rib eyes
had actually ruined my taste for Chuck
but maybe it was something else because
I did have it tonight and I actually
found it quite tasty
which is good because it's cheap here
it's about a third of the price of rib
eyes
anyway
so I vary between probably half a
kilogram and two kilograms of meat a day
it really is quite variable
so when people with my patients ask me
you know how much should they eat how
much do I eat
I kind of have to tell them that
although I genuinely don't know how much
I eat and it's hard to advise how much
they should eat
I tell them to eat when they're hungry
some days they might have three to four
meals like me other days they might just
have one
I just advise them to eat to society
stop when it stops tasting good
I believe that's the signal that your
body has had enough of whatever it is
that you're eating
I'm not a big guy I'm around 70 kgs so
you would think that maybe up to two
kilograms of beef a day sounds just a
ridiculous amount for me but as I said
I'm losing fat and gaining muscle
now I'm pretty active but not Super
Active I mean I'm really just working
out like 15-20 minutes a day it's not a
great deal
I think this just goes to show that the
body doesn't really work on calories the
and certainly the fat isn't about
calories or eating fat
it's what your body does with those
calories
and I'll be covering this in another
episode in the future
so we've spoke about what I am eating
but what about what I'm not eating
my experience with herbs and steakettes
well basically I've completely stripped
our plants all plots
I haven't consumed a single plant in
three months
actually that's not entirely true I have
had a couple of times where I've tested
to see what the effect would be like
really tiny bits of plants
and it didn't actually really go very
well at all
the first time I had some stay kits from
our usual butcher
steakheads are kind of like
um like square flat burger patties
basically
um I should really ask the butcher but
to find out what was actually in them
but they had some sort of herbs in them
probably some breadcrumbs to bind them
as well I'm not sure
kind of figured what the hell opened the
pack up saw the green and I was like oh
green is not a carnivore color uh let's
just try them and see what happens okay
fair enough they weren't moldy it was
just it was just herbs
so I kind of wish I hadn't really
um within about five minutes I just felt
totally exhausted I could barely stay
awake I started to just feel weird and
wrong
really hard to explain
but I went from feeling kind of just out
of this world on Carnivore to just to
just barely awake
actually I did go to sleep on the sofa
and I wasn't even tired five minutes
before I just couldn't
not sleep
I couldn't fight it
I woke up I think three four hours later
just achy and sore all over my body
not just because I fell asleep on the
sofa in an awkward position I mean I'd
done that plenty of times before and
felt okay nothing really hurt now this
time everything just hurt my hands my
feet my fingers my toes like every part
of me just hurt
I felt really sluggish and lethargic no
energy I couldn't even get myself up off
the sofa
but my mental health was also just just
crushed I'd gone from feeling like I
said out of this world mentally to just
not even wanting to be alive not
suicidal but just really not wanting to
live
I've gone from wanting to work out twice
a day
to wanting to just open the garage and
just throw my weights out and close it
again
honestly if I'd had the energy I
probably would have
it was really scary
a few hours later though it started to
pass and I could actually feel myself
just kind of physically and mentally
improving
like just going up those levels really
bizarre feeling
a few hours later it was pretty much
back to normal
got up off the sofa started working out
again
so again I've gone from hating loving
loving my way to hating my weights to
loving my weights again
really odd the workout pretty much
sucked but I was able to do it
and mentally I felt amazing again
really really bizarre experience maybe
it was coincidence maybe it's possible
but I've had similar episodes since with
things like burgers
um sausages I had a really bad
experience when I had some chicken with
some sort of soy based I think of a soy
based sauce on it
so Sid stopped experimenting with food
some people can go back to these things
maybe maybe one day I will but for now
I'm gonna stay pure Carnival
no plants no herbs no spices no
preservatives no seed oils and no coffee
now that one was actually surprisingly
easy
I was quite scared about getting off
coffee because I'd done it before and I
got pretty bad withdrawal
but surprisingly it was actually really
easy on Carnival I don't know why
but I've seen a few people posting
similar stories about going off coffee
when they've been doing carnivore that
they've really struggled before but now
it's easier
I've even had some patients tell me on
Carnivore
um that they've actually found less
addictive behaviors so things like
smoking they're just less inclined to do
them and it seems easier to cut down
which is absolutely fascinating
benefits of the carnivore diet
so how has the carnivore diet really
helped me
well I mean in just so many ways it's
hard to really list them all I guess the
most obvious is I've lost a lot of fat
now I started around 35 body fat
probably slightly more
didn't actually measure myself
beforehand which was a bit silly but
then I wasn't really planning on
actually doing Carnival I just kind of
did it after I went to low carb down
under and listened to Dr chafee speak
I've had a dexa scan not that long ago
before I started which showed around 35
body fat so I'm going to use that as a
guide
now I've dropped to around maybe I think
probably 25 my calipers say between 20
and 25 I think it's probably 25.
I'll get a repeat dexa scan at some
point but they're not always super super
accurate
I've not just lost a lot of fat though
I've actually gained a lot of muscle
loads of people want to lose weight but
that's really just a number on the scale
what we really want to lose is fat
now in the carnival groups you know you
see people amazing success stories
losing hundreds of pounds 200 and I saw
one that said they lost something like
150 kilos I can't even comprehend that
amount and amount of weight loss
but personally my maybe there were I
mean pounds I don't know but my weight's
actually gone up but I'm totally cool
with this because I know I've lost fat
and gained muscle
I'm pretty sure I've lost around seven
kilograms of fat at least and gained
maybe 10 kilograms of muscle
thermos maybe slightly out but I think
it's pretty accurate
I may not look enormously muscly but
I wasn't starting from a lot
so the difference is actually pretty big
at some point I'll post some pictures on
my Instagram so people that follow me
can see the changes but I'm not quite
ready for that yet
being a doctor here in Australia we have
to be pretty careful about the post what
we post on social media
and posting kind of half nude photos of
myself
May attract some unwanted attention so I
want to make sure that I'm actually
posting something that's worthwhile that
shows the changes
so I've lost a lot of weight but I think
really the best thing is actually
there's just like energy levels and
they're just through the roof
I went from feeling flat tired and
definitely old to feeling youthful and
vibrant I really do feel like a teenager
again
my figure zest for life just amazing
I just kind of want to live now and
experience life nature just be part of
the planet that we live on
these are similar stories that a lot of
other carnivores say and I was listening
to you know the podcast uh Rivera
podcast Dr Baker earlier and he was
interviewing someone and they said just
exactly the same thing and they were
saying they almost didn't want to say it
out loud because it just sounded so
ridiculous but that's how they felt and
I feel exactly the same
I definitely never felt as good when I
was doing keto or intermittent fasting
I also just want to research and read
and learn and I've actually got some
books to go through on order Dr Ken
Barry's book The Lies my doctor told me
Dr Sean Baker's book the carnivore diet
I can't wait for them to arrive and
actually start to read them
there's a couple others I want to read
as well like kind of or code by Dr Paul
saladino and the carnival Cure by
nutrition with Judy sorry I can't
remember her full name
it's great to think my energy isn't
really coming from coffee anymore
as I said I'm not drinking any caffeine
at all no pills no tea no coffee no
sodas
it's kind of crazy and sad to think I
actually needed coffee to survive before
anyway my gut issues have completely
resolved
I never had any diagnosed condition but
I've been guaranteed I basically had IBS
I used to go probably five times a day
sometimes having to rush to the toilet
you know sometimes a bit explosive
now I just go
maybe once a day at most honestly takes
about five seconds and I'm done
on with the day
my mental health has improved
I spoke previously about how I maybe had
some issues when I was at University but
never anything actually diagnosed but
there's definitely been times in my life
when I was very stressed anxious or
maybe a bit low
but now I kind of just feel amazing all
the time
people say this is abnormal and they
call it euphoria
but I think it's just how we're meant to
feel
just most of us don't feel this ever
my sleep has definitely improved
now I was lucky that I never really had
any sleep issues but there were
definitely times where I found it hard
to go to sleep or stay asleep but now I
just sleep like a baby
bizarrely
I don't wake up with a dry mouth anymore
I mouth wheel at night I just I can't
stop myself
I don't know if that's reduced but I
definitely don't really wake up with a
dry mouth anymore
speaking of mouth my dentist was very
happy when I went to see him about a
month or so ago
I've been doing Carnival about maybe a
month I think and I was quite nervous
about going
the last time I went you know he was
pretty unhappy with me my teeth weren't
that good
but this time he said my teeth were
absolutely amazing with just no plaque
and my impacted wisdom teeth both sides
they now have no observable inflammation
he said
so I'm pretty happy with that I was
pretty worried about my teeth especially
when you know you see scary stories
about scurvy on the carnivore diet
now I know um Jerry Schwartz AKA
carnivore camaraderie he did a video on
this recently claiming he had scurvy
from Carnival
now I'm not going to comment that much
on this I think it's been covered fairly
extensively but I don't think it's very
I think it's very likely the ad scurvy
there's no case reports of scary on the
Carnival diet I'd be making pretty big
news I think if there was
another small but I think really
significant change is my dandruff has
completely gone
which is really really nice dandruff's
one of those conditions that
seems small but it really can affect
people's confidence and just really
affect them
now I got to the point I was even
getting eyebrow dandruff which is
weird and unpleasant
that's completely gone
now I'm pretty sure the hair on top of
my head is regrowing slowly I can't be
sure but definitely under here oh sorry
I'm pointing to underneath my chin uh
it's filling in I had a little bald spot
there which is now filling in
now
I like to think I don't really care
about my pretty bald head but truth be
told you know I'd love to have more hair
I'd never really get implants I don't
think but yep it naturally grew yeah of
course I'd be very very happy
my personal life has greatly improved
especially at home
now my wife is certainly very happy with
the changes
no not what you're thinking get your
mind out of the gutter well actually no
that has improved a little bit but what
I mean is I'm organized and active I
want to clean
I want to tidy organize the house do
laundry ironing cooking just generally
be productive
I've also noticed amazing changes in my
kids I'll be covering kids in another
episode but our kids aren't really doing
full Carnival but they are eating a lot
more red meat and less sugar and a lot
more fat and I've noticed their behavior
is definitely better more attentive more
keen to learn do arts and crafts and
just generally less TV time
they're growing like crazy as well
and my little Carnival baby as we call
her our two-year-old Freya she wasn't a
pure carnivore but she mostly just ate
mate from the very early on and she is
huge for her age incredibly strong
athletic and super intelligent she's
just turned two she's basically already
toilet trained
all my kids are very intelligent of
course and I love them all dearly and
equally of course
but there's no denying that there is a
difference between the two that weren't
really that carnivore and the one that
is
so where am I going from here
I'm definitely going to continue
carnivore now if I ever stop feeling
good I'll I'll reassess
but the way that I feel now I doubt I'll
ever stop
it's only been two to three months so
far but there's really nothing but
my blood test results
positives no negatives at all
my Bloods are amazing my audio is up a
little bit of course
but I don't really care about that in
fact it's actually a good thing there's
a lot of studies that show a high LDL
it's protective for heart disease and
all cause mortality
my information is way down
my insulin resistance is way down by
triglycerides are way down my HDL is way
up all my biomarkers for heart disease
and inflammation are just non-existent
my LDL excuse me is up but my
lipoprotein little a LPA is completely
undetectable now this is a marker for
damaged LDL cholesterol
best of all
my free testosterone has gone up by well
over 50 really about 70 in two months
that's incredible
that's probably why I feel so good
my kidney function is perfect and in
fact many people find their kidney
functions improve on Carnivore diet
we don't need to fear the protein in the
kidneys it's extremely hard to damage
your kidneys with protein and really
what damages it more than anything else
is sugar
I'm not finding it in any way difficult
there's really no gray areas like there
is on car a low carb or Keto
I find it very easy for me it's just
it's pretty black and white
so I'm starting to talk to my patients
about it and I wanted to start this
podcast to spread the word
some of my patients especially the
vegans ask me how do I Square this with
my Medical Education and Training
after all we're told repeatedly that red
meat is bad cholesterol is bad carbs and
plants are good
now to truth be told I am still
struggling a little bit with this one
because it does contradict everything
that I'm taught
but there's really no denying how I feel
early on in medical school I was
actually taught that medicine is not
static and we should always be learning
we should always be questioning and
testing sadly though this isn't really
done anymore
I believe that information moves on and
we need to move with it
it's hard though when the whole medical
establishment is telling you that you're
wrong and that so those of us that are
doing this kind of work we actually have
to be pretty careful we have to know our
share be able to size studies and
supporting evidence and potentially
defend ourselves publicly
so it's a bit scary to actually put
yourself out there but I think it's
worth it and I'm taking this risk
I can't just sit by knowing that I could
help countless people and I certainly
can't just keep post pushing harmful
drugs on people rather than trying to
fix them with diet and nutrition

## Conclusion

If you are
looking for a guide as I said I do have
a guide available on a kind of or Diet
Link in the description down below
but basically for most people you don't
really need a guide it's pretty
intuitive eating eat when you're hungry
don't eat when you're not eat what your
body is telling you to eat if your
body's telling you to eat beef eat the
beef if you open up the fridge and the
chicken looks good eat the chicken if
your pork looks good eat the pork it's
pretty simple straightforward you're not
going to go that far wrong with doing
that approach
