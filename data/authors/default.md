Born and raised in England, UK, I knew from an early age I wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to help people, and heal them, and I was naturally attracted to General Practice - Primary Care. I attended medical school in England and after graduating did my early house jobs and registrar training in England as well. I was lucky enough to learn under some amazing doctors who taught me a great deal about treating patients in the right way, how to listen and learn from them, and how to actually try to understand disease processes and how the human body worked rather than just rely on guidelines to direct how I treated people. I am truly blessed that they also instilled in me a desire to treat people without medications, and to actually reduce and stop medications where possible, which unfortunately is not common in the medical profession.

I later moved to Australia with my wife and then 1 daughter (now I have 3 and another on the way as well).

I was already a Specialist GP when I moved, but now I'm also a Board Certified Lifestyle Physician. As well as further training in areas like skin cancer and mental health, I also have quite extensive extra training in nutrition having studied with ASLM, IBLM, ACNEM and Diet Doctor.

As a GP I see people with all sorts of issues, some acute, some chronic. My primary focus is on chronic disease, and really on preventative care where possible. I run dedicated functional health and lifestyle medicine clinics for my patients, and often see people who have 'medical unexplained symptoms', difficult diagnoses, or those who unfortunately have become disillusioned with the medical system and are seeking something different.

I like to fully explore my patients' symptoms, not just their diagnoses, as often links can be made with their other conditions, and a common source can then be identified. In my experience, this is almost always diet and nutrition related, often from eating exactly what the mainstream medical profession and government tells them eat, yet people are sick of being sick.

I work extensively with low carb nutrition in my usual practice, and it use to help people with a vast array of issues, and my focus is on holistic care, preferring to avoid medication prescriptions where possible and instead utilizing lifestyle interventions.

My real passion though is helping people to help themselves. I'm a huge believer in educating my patients and empowering them to prevent and treat chronic diseases themselves. My goal is to get to the point where my patients never actually need me. Then my job is done.

As well as my in-hours face to face consulting, I now also offering out of hours video consults for Lifestyle / Functional Medicine consults, as well as psychotherapy and counselling.

Finally, I'm extremely excited to announce The Meat Medic Discord Community Server - a place where we can all meet, chat, hang out, and get support with our health issues. Further support is available to those who need it through my [membership](url=https://themeatmedic.com/member) programs.
